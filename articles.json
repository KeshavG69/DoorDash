We suggest to make sure to bring a Red Card with you so that you can accept these offers and take advantage of every earning opportunity. Most merchants accept contactless payments so you will likely be able to check out with a digital card. If you are checking out at a merchant that does not accept contactless payments, you can use your physical Red Card if you have one. If you do not have a physical Red Card, you have the option to use your personal card, keep the receipt, and reach out to support for reimbursement. \n\nHow do I get a digital Red Card?\nIt\u2019s simple - it just takes a minute from your Dasher app\n\nFor iOS\nGo to the \u2018Account\u2019 tab of your Dasher app \nTap \u201cDasher Red Card\u201d\nTap \u201cAdd to Apple Wallet\u201d to get your card\nIf prompted to choose a device, select your phone name \nCard information will automatically populate\nAccept the Terms & Condition\nOnce successfully added, your \u2018Dasher Red Card\u2019 tab should show \u2018Active in Apple Wallet\u2019 \n\n\nFor Android\n1.

        "page_content": "Requirements for Dashing\nNOTE: This article only applies to Dashers in the United States and Canada.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ: What\u2019s required to dash?\nA: You must be at least 18* years old, have an iPhone or Android smartphone, and complete the sign-up process.\n*Prospective Dashers in Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia must be at least 19 years old.\n\nQ: What are the phone requirements to dash?\nA: Dashers can use their iOS or Android phones. Certain jailbroken or rooted phones may have trouble accessing the Dasher app. If you are having trouble accessing the Dasher App after multiple attempts, you can try to reset your phone or login using another phone altogether.\n\nDashing with a newer phone that has more memory can help reduce issues with crashes and restarts. On average, newer phones with >3GB RAM crash and freeze less than others. Consider upgrading your device to help improve your experience while dashing.\n\nQ: Can someone else drive for me and/or help me drop off deliveries?\nA: As an independent contractor, you are free to choose the method by which you perform the delivery. It is entirely up to you to complete the delivery service yourself or to delegate the tasks to your employee or subcontractor. Someone else may drive for you or help you drop off deliveries, however they must have a valid Dasher account as well. For more information, please refer to the Independent Contractor Agreement here (link Section 8 of the ICA (Personnel)).\n\nQ: Are there vehicle requirements for driving? \nA: No! You can use any car to deliver. Just have a valid domestic driver\u2019s license, insurance, and a clean driving record. In certain markets, you can also dash via motorcycle, bike, e-bike, or scooter.\n\nQ: Does DoorDash have insurance? \nA: Yes, DoorDash has a commercial auto insurance policy that covers up to $1,000,000 in bodily injury and/or property damage to third parties arising out of accidents while on an active delivery. More information is available here.\n\nQ: What if I get injured while making a delivery?\nA: For U.S. Dashers: If you suffer an injury while making a delivery with DoorDash, you may be eligible for occupational accident coverage. Occupational accident insurance offers several important benefits due to covered accidents for Dashers including medical expenses, disability payments, and survivors benefits. For more information, visit Occupational Accident Policy FAQ.\n\nQ: Do I need my own insurance?\nA: Yes, while doing business as an independent contractor, you are required to maintain your own insurance, in the amounts and of types required by law which includes, but is not limited to, an auto insurance policy. If you fail to maintain your own insurance, DoorDash's coverage may not apply.\n\nQ: Are other vehicles besides cars allowed? \nA: Depending on your local market, you may be able to use motorcycles, scooters, or bikes (including e-bikes).\n\nSIGN UP TO DELIVER WITH DOORDASH",

Why can't I continue to sign up?\nWhat happens if I have a new record since my most recent background check report?\nHow does that process work and how long does it take?\nHow do I dispute the accuracy of my background check or provide more information for DoorDash to consider in its decision?\nMy background check is 'suspended'. What does this mean?\nI received the 'Pre-Adverse Action Notice' email, what can I do?\nI received a'Post-Adverse Action Notice' email, what can I do?\n\nOverview\n\nAs part of our commitment to help protect the DoorDash community, we are constantly evaluating new ways to help promote safety on the platform. Anyone signing up to dash must pass a secure background check before gaining access to the DoorDash platform.\n\nMost Frequently Asked Questions\n\nQ: What is the process?\nA: DoorDash uses accredited third-party background check providers, including Checkr to run secure background checks on all prospective and existing Dashers. Background checks are initiated as part of the signup process, before allowing individuals to access the platform to accept offers as new Dashers. For the continued safety and security of all members of our community, background check reruns are performed under certain circumstances. This allows us to receive and evaluate potential new or updated criminal history records through real-time data sources.\n\nAdditionally, Checkr provides a continuous check feature that can report new offenses occurring after your initial complete background check.\n\nQ: What information is contained in a background check?\nA: Background checks consist of the following:\nMotor Vehicle Report (if using a motor vehicle to dash)\nCriminal History Report\n\nQ: What happens if I have a new record since my most recent background check report?\nA: If your report reflects an incident or information that results in you no longer meeting the background check criteria, your Dasher account will be deactivated from the platform. You will receive an email if this happens.\n\nQ: How does that process work and how long does it take?\nA: If such a record is flagged in your report, you will be notified with a Pre-Adverse Action notice attached to an email sent from no-reply@checkr.com before any deactivation action is taken. That notice will include a copy of your report and additional information, including how you can dispute the accuracy of any information in the background check or provide additional information to be considered. \n\nIf you do not provide any additional information, or dispute the accuracy of your background check with Checkr, within the number of days provided in your Pre-Adverse Action Notice, you will receive a Post-Adverse action notice that provides an explanation of the final decision, and your Dasher account will be deactivated.\n\nQ: How do I dispute the accuracy of my background check or provide more information for DoorDash to consider in its decision?\nA: All of the information needed to dispute the accuracy of background check with Checkr, or to provide additional information to Doordash for consideration, is contained in the Pre-Adverse Action notice attached to the email from no-reply@checkr.com. If you believe the findings of the Checkr report are inaccurate (e.g., the charge(s) listed are not your own, details of the charge are incorrect, out of date, etc.), please contact Checkr via their Checkr Candidate Portal. Through the candidate portal, please follow the dispute process which involves specifying what you believe to be inaccurate on your report and following the appropriate steps. For questions or assistance, please contact Checkr Support.\n\nQ: My background check is 'suspended'. What does that mean?\nA: This usually indicates that you need to provide Checkr with additional information or documentation in order for your background check to continue processing. You should have received an email from no-reply@checkr.com with instructions, or you can log into the Checkr Candidate Portal to view the status of your background check.\n\nQ: Why is my report taking such a long time?\nA: While most background checks are completed within a day, it is not uncommon to encounter longer wait times of one to two weeks due to factors such as DMV and local county office delays. Recall that process includes both a criminal background check and, for those who indicate they will deliver by motorized vehicle, a motor vehicle report check. Individuals who plan to deliver by bicycle do not need to undergo a motor vehicle report check. Please visit the Checkr Candidate Portal for the most up-to-date estimates.\n\nBecause the checks are performed by Checkr, not DoorDash, DoorDash is unable to expedite or provide estimated completion times. Contact Checkr Support if you have any further questions about processing times.\n\nQ: Checkr says my report is complete. Why can't I continue to sign up?\nA: Complete is a term that Checkr uses to indicate it has finished compiling the information on a report.

Feel free to ask the merchant to help you do a final item check.\nIf you are missing an item or have a different item than the order states, ask the merchant if the item is unavailable or substituted. If the merchant confirms unavailable or substituted, report this using the three dots next to the item in the Dasher app pickup screen.

If you are doing it on your phone, you will need to record a short video where you hold your two pieces of ID up by your face and state your full name. Once you finish the video, you can upload it to the Checkr portal and it will take 3-5 minutes for an agent to verify your video.\n\nQ: Does DoorDash keep any of this information from the background check?\nA: No - DoorDash does not keep any information from the background check. All information resides with Checkr and is not shared with us.\n\nQ: How can I check the status of my background check?\nA: Background checks are processed through our third-party consumer reporting agency, Checkr. Processing your background check can take between 5-7 business days, sometimes longer. You can reach out to Checkr to determine the status of your background check by:\nIf you are from Canada\nEmail canadasupport@checkr.com to directly request the status of your application.",

        "page_content": "Delivering Tobacco Guidelines\nDoorDash does not currently allow Merchants to directly sell tobacco products, electronic cigarettes, or other similar products on our consumer-facing Marketplace platform.\nHowever, in some states, provinces, and territories where it is legal, Merchants with a tobacco-specific agreement with DoorDash may request Dasher delivery of tobacco products that customers have purchased directly from the Merchant through the Merchant\u2019s own channels or through other platforms.  \nThe following information is intended to help you responsibly and lawfully deliver tobacco products in those circumstances.  Please note that you could be held liable if you deliver tobacco products to a minor, so it's important that you follow this process fully to protect yourself, the customer, and the health and safety of minors.  As a reminder, you are free to decline any delivery offer, including tobacco deliveries.\nI. TOBACCO PRODUCT PICK-UP\nTobacco orders are age-restricted in accordance with local law.  In order to pick up a tobacco order, you will be required to present your valid driver's license or another valid government-issued ID, so please make sure you have your ID on you before accepting the order.\n\nII. TOBACCO PRODUCT DROP-OFF\nA. AGE AND ID VERIFICATION\nYou can only deliver tobacco products to a customer if the customer meets the minimum age requirement under local law:\n21+ in the U.S.\n18+ in Australia; or \n18, 19, or 21+ in Canada in accordance with provincial law.\nTo verify age, ask the customer to see a valid ID.  Check every customer\u2019s ID every time, even if the customer clearly appears to be over the legally-required age.  A valid ID must include a photograph and date of birth.  For example, acceptable forms of ID may include:\nA valid driver's license or identification card issued by federal, state, provincial, county, or municipal government.\nA valid passport.\nAn identification card issued by the Armed Forces of the United States that contains the name, date of birth, description, and picture of the person.\nNext, make sure the ID is not invalid or fake:\nCheck the expiration date. Do not accept an ID that is expired.\nAsk to remove the ID from the wallet.\nCompare the customer at the door to the photo in the ID.  Examine facial features: are the height, eye shape, ear and nose shape or placement similar?  Ignore weight, hair and makeup as these may change.\nFeel the edges of the ID - a legitimate ID will have smooth, uniform edges.  A fake ID may have rougher edges and perhaps may be coming apart.\nLook for glue lines or bumpy or uneven surfaces. A real ID\u2019s surface should be consistent.\nIf the customer\u2019s ID check fails your physical examination or an app-prompted ID scan, do not complete the delivery; instead, return the tobacco product(s) to the merchant.\n\nB. RESTRICTED LOCATIONS\nDo NOT, under any circumstances, deliver tobacco products to the following locations:\nPublic or private school (K-12) (e.g. an elementary school);\nHospitals & health care facilities;\nSports venues or any place hosting a sporting event;\nCollege campus (e.g. a fraternity house, residence hall, library);\nPrison, reformatory, veterans\u2019 home, or state capitol grounds;\nP.O. Boxes;\nLocker or similar package storage service (e.g. a storage facility); or\nOther business that sells tobacco products (e.g. tobacco retail shop).\nC.  JUDGMENT\nLastly, use your judgment. If you have any doubts about the ID or the customer, or encounter a situation in which it does not seem reasonable to deliver a tobacco product (e.g., a location where minors are present and appear to be the intended recipients), do not complete delivery and contact support.\nIII. DECLINE CUSTOMER-INITIATED REQUESTS FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS\nIf a customer reaches out to you directly (e.g., via the in-app chat feature or by phone) to request that you add a tobacco product to their order, it is important to decline the request.  Third party delivery of tobacco products is illegal in many states.  Even in states where tobacco delivery is legal, initiating the delivery outside of normal processes violates DoorDash\u2019s Consumer Terms and Dasher Policies, and could also unintentionally result in a noncompliant delivery - e.g., a delivery without an ID check and/or without collection of a signature upon delivery.  Declining the request will protect you, the merchant, the customer, and DoorDash.  If the customer is insistent with their request, you can always contact support for assistance.\n ",

If you wish to opt-out of this type of delivery, please submit your request to support@doordash.com. In addition, if you ever receive an alcohol order you do not wish to perform, you have the option to decline the order before accepting it or cancel the order before picking it up from the merchant.\nAlcohol Delivery:\nWhile on a dash, you may see orders containing alcoholic beverages, and the following information is intended to help you lawfully deliver alcohol with DoorDash. You could be held liable if you deliver alcohol to a minor or someone who is visibly intoxicated or if you leave the alcohol unattended, so it\u2019s important that you know what to do to protect yourself and the consumer.\n\nImportant reminders:\nYou must check the recipient\u2019s identity by following instructions in the Dasher app before you hand them an order containing alcohol. You will be prompted to scan ID and also visually compare the recipient\u2019s appearance to the ID they provide. You cannot leave an alcohol order unattended or hand it to someone else who cannot produce a valid ID.\nDashers cannot consume alcohol prior to or while dashing\u2014or be under the influence of anything.\nDashers must be of legal drinking age (21+) and have a valid government-issued ID to deliver orders containing alcohol. Have your ID ready when you pick up the order\u2014merchants will ask for it. \nThis is serious business. You may be held criminally liable if you provide alcohol to a person who is underage or intoxicated or leave alcohol unattended.\n\nLiability for an unlawful alcohol delivery may include:\nFines or jail time.\nCivil lawsuits that individuals may bring against delivery persons to recover damages for personal injury or property resulting from an unlawful alcohol delivery, which typically results in a monetary fine (but a criminal action can result in jail time).\nDoorDash may also take such other remedial action up to and including deactivation from the DoorDash platform.

You can access the required module through your Dasher app under your \u2018Profile\u2019.\n  How do I know if the order contains alcohol?\nYou'll see a notice on the screen indicating the order contains restricted items, including alcohol.\nOnce you click \u201cAccept'', the Dasher app will include the steps required to deliver alcohol safely and compliantly in accordance with applicable state law.\n\n  Key delivery rules to remember\nDon't accept additional orders or special requests for alcohol directly from the consumers (for example, if they reach out via text or message you in the app)\nDon't leave an order unattended for a consumer to collect. You must deliver the order in person, scan a valid form of ID, and then do a physical examination of the ID, all before handing over the order to the recipient.\nUse your best judgment. Remember, you can always refuse to deliver if a person appears below the legal drinking age but presents an ID saying they are older or, if they are of legal drinking age, but are at a location with several other persons who appear under the age. Circumstances matter, so be vigilant, especially when near locations with persons typically under the legal drinking age, such as college campuses.\n\nRestricted locations\nPublic or private school (K-12) (such as an elementary school);\nCollege campus (including a fraternity or sorority house);\nPrison, reformatory, veterans\u2019 home, or state capitol grounds;\nLocker or similar package storage service (such as a storage facility); or\nBusiness that sells alcohol (like a grocery or liquor store).\nIf you arrive at a consumer\u2019s address with an alcohol order, and you see that the address is, or you reasonably suspect that it is, one of the above locations, you are empowered to refuse delivery. Follow the \u201cCan\u2019t complete delivery\u201d instructions in your Dasher app which will guide you on what to do with the alcohol.\n  How to verify the consumer\u2019s identity\n(Remember: you must verify the consumer\u2019s identity and that they are over the legal drinking age before handing them the order)\n\nFollow the steps in the Dasher app. Upon delivery, you\u2019ll be prompted to scan the recipient\u2019s physical ID, which looks like this:\n    \nTo the extent the scan is successful and the app indicates that the ID is valid, then do a physical examination of the ID to ensure that it is valid and that it matches the recipient. Take a close and long look \u2014 make sure the person on the ID is the same person you\u2019re handing the order to, that the ID is not expired, does not display any evidence of fraud (more details on that below), and is for an individual over the legal drinking age. Only hand over the alcohol after having successfully completed these two ID checks.\n\nNote: In states that require a signature, you\u2019ll also be prompted to collect the consumer\u2019s signature.\n\nThere are 4 valid, acceptable forms of ID:\nState ID Card or Driver\u2019s License\nU.S. Military ID\nU.S. Passport\nForeign Country Passport\nThese are INVALID, non-acceptable forms of ID:\nNon-government ID (ex. college ID or work ID)\nCredit Card\nPrinted copy or photo of an ID\nExpired IDs\nWhat to check a physical ID for:\nCheck the photo and physical description to make sure they match the consumer.\nConfirm both the expiration date and the consumer\u2019s date of birth.\nFor physical IDs, hold it to see if it\u2019s been tampered with or if it looks like a fake.\nSome things to consider for confirming a valid physical ID:\nSome states use raised text or embossed elements that you can feel on valid IDs.\nA valid ID will NOT include images of a lock or key. \nIn some states, a valid ID can also include holographic images. These 3D images change when the ID is viewed at different angles.\nHow to spot a fake:\nThe edges of a valid ID should be smooth and uniform, whereas the edges of a fake ID may be rougher or coming apart.\nValid identification should NOT include words like 'genuine', 'souvenir', 'official', 'novelty' or 'authentic'.\nIf the lamination is split, thin, or has bubbles, it may have been tampered with.\nSeverely damaged IDs should not be accepted.\nRemember, you can always refuse to deliver if a person appears below the legal drinking age but presents an ID saying they are older.\n  Preventing Delivery to Underage Customers\nRules in the United States\n\nBy law, you must be 21 years or older to purchase, possess, or consume alcohol.\nPeople under the legal drinking age may not purchase or receive alcohol.\nPeople of the legal drinking age or older may not purchase alcohol on behalf of someone under the legal drinking age.\nWhy staying compliant matters\nBe sure to follow the law. If a delivery person makes an illegal alcohol delivery, they may be personally liable. Fines or jail time can be issued to you by government authorities, and individuals may bring lawsuits against a delivery person to recover damages for personal injury or property.\n\nRemember, we\u2019re here to support you! If you have any questions before, during, or after a dash, get in touch with us through the Dasher app.\nPreventing Delivery to Intoxicated Customers\nIt's illegal to serve someone alcohol who is already intoxicated. The law requires that alcohol SHOULD NOT be delivered to a consumer who appears to be intoxicated with any substance (such as alcohol or cannabis, for example).\nHere are some common signs that someone\u2019s had too much to drink:\nLook for glassy or bloodshot eyes or if someone clearly has difficulty keeping their eyes open.\nIf you notice that the person\u2019s breath or clothes smell of alcohol, this may be an effective tell-tale sign of intoxication.\nIf someone is having trouble walking in a straight line or is fumbling with objects, this may be a sign that they are intoxicated.\nUse your best judgment.\nHow to refuse delivery\nYour right to refuse delivery\nIf you suspect someone is underage or intoxicated, you ALWAYS have the right to refuse delivery of alcohol. \nIf no one is home to accept an order, you must not complete the delivery.\nIf you are suspicious that the recipient is using a fake ID, do not deliver alcohol products to them. \nIf you suspect that the consumer is accepting the delivery on behalf of someone else who is underage, you must refuse delivery. \nHow to refuse delivery\nPolitely tell the consumer that you cannot deliver the alcohol.\nFollow the instructions in your Dasher app which will guide you on what to do with the alcohol.\nShould a potentially tricky situation arise, get to a safe location and call the police \nWhat to do with undeliverable orders\n\nWhat if no one is home?\nAlcohol cannot, under ANY circumstances, be left unattended at a consumer\u2019s door.\nFollow the \"consumer unavailable\u201d instructions and the Dasher app will prompt you to return the alcohol to the store.\nNew Jersey Dasher Requirements\nDelivery Worker (i.e., each Dasher) acknowledges that, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 33:1-35 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act (\"ABC Act\"), as an independent contractor providing contracted services through the DoorDash Platform, governed by the DoorDash Independent Contractor Agreement and the Delivering Alcohol Guidelines included therein, he or she is required to cooperate with inspections and investigations conducted by any authorized representative of the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (\"NJABC\"), upon presentation of credentials, and to provide documentation or other items and information upon demand in accordance with the requirements of this permit, the ABC Act and regulations. Delivery Worker agrees to fully cooperate with any inspection or investigation by NJABC. Failure to cooperate with an inspection or investigation may result in administrative charges being issued against the Permittee (i.e., DoorDash).   \nDelivery Worker acknowledges that DoorDash is required to terminate its agreement for alcohol delivery with any Delivery Worker who violates this permit (i.e., DoorDash's third party alcohol delivery permit), the ABC Act or regulations.\nAppendix: step-by-step guide\nCheck out this step-by-step guide below to navigating orders in-app\u2014you\u2019ll see exactly what the deliveries look like as well as the steps to complete a compliant, successful delivery.\n\nHow to tell if the order contains alcohol?\n\nYou'll see a notice on the screen indicating the order contains restricted items, including alcohol. When you accept, be sure to have your ID ready to present to the Merchant when picking up the order. Note that Dashers must be at the legal drinking age and have a valid government-issued ID to deliver orders containing alcohol.\n    Drop-off instructions\nWhen delivering alcohol, you must follow each step in the Dasher app. You\u2019ll be prompted to scan the customer\u2019s ID and verify their identity BEFORE you hand over the alcohol.

A: You will see a notice that looks like a warning that you may be at the wrong location and you will see options for what you can do next.

Red Cards are not linked to Dasher bank accounts or related to earnings.\nRed Cards can be:\nDigital - stored in the digital wallet in your phone (recommended)\nPhysical - physical card ordered from the DoorDash store\n\nWhy do I need a Red Card?\nDoorDash Shop & Deliver offers can only be completed with a Red Card. We suggest to make sure to bring a Red Card with you so that you can accept these offers and take advantage of every earning opportunity. Most merchants accept contactless payments so you will likely be able to check out with a digital card. If you are checking out at a merchant that does not accept contactless payments, you can use your physical Red Card if you have one. If you do not have a physical Red Card, you have the option to use your personal card, keep the receipt, and reach out to support for reimbursement. \n\nHow do I get a digital Red Card?\nIt\u2019s simple - it just takes a minute from your Dasher app\n\nFor iOS\nGo to the \u2018Account\u2019 tab of your Dasher app \nTap \u201cDasher Red Card\u201d\nTap \u201cAdd to Apple Wallet\u201d to get your card\nIf prompted to choose a device, select your phone name \nCard information will automatically populate\nAccept the Terms & Condition\nOnce successfully added, your \u2018Dasher Red Card\u2019 tab should show \u2018Active in Apple Wallet\u2019 \n\n\nFor Android\n1.

DoorDash cannot provide you with tax advice nor can we verify the accuracy of any publicly available tax guidance online. \n\nKeep in mind: DoorDash does not automatically withhold taxes.

We strongly suggest opting into paperless delivery (i.e., agree to receive your 1099 tax form electronically via Stripe Express) to ensure you receive your 1099 quickly. You will need an account to download your 1099 tax form.\nBy December 31, 2024: Confirm your tax information (e.g., name, address, and SSN or EIN) is correct via Stripe Express.

The forms are filed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and, if required, state tax departments. A 1099-NEC form summarizes Dashers' earnings as independent contractors in the US. It\u2019s provided to you and the IRS, as well as some US states, if you earn $600 or more in 2024. If you're a Dasher, you\u2019ll need this form to file your taxes.\n\nQ: What tax forms will be sent?  \nA: The only tax form that eligible Dashers will receive is the 1099-NEC, and this is ONLY for Dashers who earn $600 or more on the platform in 2024. Dashers who earn less will NOT receive a 1099 form.\n\nQ: How will tax forms be delivered?\nA: Eligible Dashers who earned more than $600 in 2024 will be receiving an email invite to create a Stripe Express account by mid-January 2025. The email subject line is \u201cGet your DoorDash 2024 tax forms faster by enabling e-delivery\u201d. If you do not receive the email invitation before mid-January but earned $600 or more in 2024 on DoorDash, contact DoorDash support by clicking here. Please note that you will only receive a 1099-NEC if you earned $600 or more in 2024.\n\nQ: How can I check my mileage for tax deduction purposes?  \nA: As an independent contractor, managing your own business and expenses can be tough. Your business-related mileage can be a significant expense, so if you know how many miles you drove, you may be able to reduce the amount you owe for taxes (or increase your refund). See here for an IRS publication on Standard Mileage Rates at a Glance.\nDoorDash will send mileage estimate emails in late February 2025 to US & Canada Dashers active during 2024 who dashed by Car and had on-delivery mileage.\n\nKeep in mind that DoorDash does not provide you with tax advice. If you have any questions about your own taxes and what business-related expenses may be deductible, please consult a tax professional.\n\nQ: How do I update my tax information?\nA: Dashers who earned more than $600 in 2024 should receive email invitations from Stripe by mid-January 2025. Click the \u201cGet Started\u201d button in the invite email and follow the steps to set up your Stripe Express account. You\u2019ll be able to review and edit your tax information directly in Stripe Express. Please update your information no later than December 31st, 2024.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to update your Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), which would be either your Social Security Number (SSN) or Employer Identification Number (EIN), please note that you will first need to create a Stripe Express account using the invitation sent to you. If you already created your account and have access to your e-copy of your 1099-NEC, please follow these steps: Go to the \u2018Platform Settings\u2019 \u2192 Select the arrow \u2192 Select the pencil icon under \u2018Personal Details\u2019 to edit the Social Security Number or Employer Identification Number.\n\nPlease note: If you don\u2019t consent to e-delivery by mid-January 2025, we\u2019ll automatically mail your 1099 tax form to the address on file, so it\u2019s critical that your information is current, correct, and complete. You can still update your information via Stripe Express after mid-January 2025 and download your 1099 electronically. However, you will not be mailed a new paper copy of your 1099 tax form.\n\nQ: How can I download my 1099 tax form?\nA: If you create a Stripe Express account and agree to paperless delivery, Stripe will email you to let you know when your 1099 tax form is available for download via Stripe Express. If you don\u2019t agree to paperless delivery, Stripe will mail you a paper copy of your 1099 tax form instead.\n\n\nQ: I did not receive the invitation email from Stripe.\nA: Dashers who earned more than $600 in 2024 should receive email invitations from Stripe by mid-January 2025. Emails will be sent out in phases to eligible Dashers starting in October 2024. If you did not receive an invitation from Stripe but believe you should have received one based on your 2024 earnings, please check the following:\nCheck your spam and deleted folders. The subject of the email is \u201cGet your DoorDash 2024 tax forms faster by enabling e-delivery\u201d.\nConfirm that you have the correct email address added to your DoorDash Dasher account.\nConfirm whether you earned $600 or more on DoorDash in 2024. If you earned less than $600 in 2024, you will not receive a 1099-NEC form or the Stripe invitation.\nImportant: If you confirmed all of the above, please contact DoorDash support by clicking here. Please note that if you did not receive the Stripe invitation but did earn $600 or more during the year 2024, please allow up to 10 business days from January 31, 2025 for mail delivery. You can request a new invite email from Stripe by following the steps at the link here.\n\nQ: How do I get in touch with Stripe or DoorDash for more help?\nA: If you still need help, please contact Stripe support. To contact DoorDash support, click here. We recommend looking through the 1099 tax forms resource pages.\n\nQ: How do I login to my Stripe Express account?\nA: Please note that in order to log into your Stripe Express account, you would have had to accept the Stripe Express invitation that will be sent to you via email. If you are having issues logging in after creating an account, please click here.\n\nQ: I no longer have access to the phone number I signed up with. How do I login to my Stripe Express account?\nA: If you\u2019ve lost or updated your phone number, you can select the \u201cI no longer have access to this phone number\u201d option to authenticate via email and change your phone number.\n\nQ: Why is Stripe requesting my Social Security number (SSN), Employer Identification Number (EIN), or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)?\nA: Your SSN, EIN, or ITIN is required to file your 1099 tax form with the IRS and relevant state tax authorities.\n\nQ: When answering the account claim security questions, it states that my answers are incorrect, what should I do?\nA: Please reach out to DoorDash support to confirm the information that we have on file against the information you are providing.\n\nQ: How can I get my 2024 DoorDash earnings history?\nA: Dashers do not need to calculate their 2024 earnings themselves - that will be clearly indicated on your 1099 form. However, if you want to estimate your earnings prior to receiving your 1099 form:\nAll Dashers can do so by logging in to Stripe Express. \nDashers who had earnings deposited through DasherDirect should also check their Payfare account (via the app DasherDirect By Payfare) because DasherDirect deposits are not reflected in Stripe Express. \nYou can view and download your monthly earnings statements on the Dasher App, please click here for more information.\n\nNote that reimbursements (e.g., if you paid for an offer with cash) are not included in 1099 earnings because reimbursements are not taxable.\n\n\nDashers in Canada\n \nDoorDash does not provide any tax documents or tax advice to Dashers in Canada. Please consult your local tax authorities for information. \n\nHow can I check my mileage for tax deduction purposes?  \nIf you used DoorDash\u2019s partner Everlance throughout 2024, that is the best place to retrieve your mileage. For more information on mileage tracking and Everlance, please click here. \nDoorDash will send mileage estimate emails on in late February 2025 to US & Canada Dashers active during 2024 who dashed by Car and had on-delivery mileage.\n\nDashers in Australia\nDashers in Australia, please consult this article for further information.",

Sometimes, you may even get multiple offers at the same time or sequentially. These are called \u201cbatched offers\u201d.\n\nWhat are the advantages of batched offers?\nBatched offers allow Dashers to quickly complete two or more orders in less time than usual. Often, batched offers will be picked up at the same restaurant, which increases a Dasher's earnings and efficiency. These batches may happen from time to time, especially during peak hours.\nHow can I accept and complete batched offers?\nYou can accept a batched offers one of two ways:\nAccepting an offer that shows 2 or more orders on the offer screen\nAccepting an additional offer while on your way to pick up the first order, by clicking the \"Add to Route\" button\nTo simplify completing batched offers, the Dasher app will suggest an order of operations for the batch, but as always, you are free to use your best judgment when choosing how to deliver each order. To see all of the orders during a batched offer (and switch between them if you wish), tap the menu at the top of the Dasher app.\n\nNote that when Peak Pay is in effect, it may be paid per single or batched delivery.",

The Dashers with the highest earnings are typically those who actively accept and complete a high number of delivery requests.\n\nGetting more offers\n\nTiming is Everything\nThe most active times for orders tend to be around lunch and dinner. Log on and be ready to accept offers during these peak hours when demand from customers is at its highest.\nTake Advantage of Peak Pay\nKeep an eye on Peak Pay campaigns within the Dasher app, where you can earn extra money on top of the standard pay for each delivery. These campaigns are usually available during the busiest times and in busy areas.\nRed Card (U.S only) and Proximity\nHaving your Red Card on hand allows you to receive a wider range of orders. Additionally, staying as close to the merchants as possible not only can get you orders faster but also maximize your efficiency.\nEquipment and Dash Preferences\nMake sure that your account preferences are set to maximize your delivery opportunities. Certain orders may also require you to have a specific type of vehicle. It\u2019s a good idea to periodically review your settings to ensure they align with your current availability and capabilities.\nHotspots Are Your Friend\nWatch for areas marked with a red flame icon, known as hotspots. These are prime locations for accepting offers due to their proximity to restaurants with frequent orders. Positioning yourself near these hotspots can increase the likelihood of receiving more delivery requests.\nSeek Out High-Demand Areas\nYour Dasher app is designed to help you identify the busiest areas with a color-coded map \u2013 red zones often represent areas with a higher number of available orders.\nExpert Advice\nHere is advice from a very experienced Dasher in California named Tamara. She has done 1400+ deliveries, and she has some great advice for accepting the most offers and earning the most money while dashing!\nDasher Advice from Tamara - Maximizing Earnings from DoorDash on Youtube.\n\nPlease note that market conditions vary and the experiences of Dashers can differ based on a number of factors.

To see if a referral bonus is currently available in your area, click on the \u201cPromos\u201d button on the Dash tab or navigate to the Account tab. If there is a live referral bonus, a \"Refer a friend to dash!\" banner will appear at the top of the screen. Clicking into it will show the bonus amount you'd each receive if the person you refer completes the required number of deliveries in the given timeframe. To send a referral link, click the icon on the banner at the bottom, or simply tap on the link to copy the url to your clipboard. \n   How do I know if my friend has successfully been referred?\n\nTo successfully accept your referral, your friend must be a new Dasher (has never created a Dasher account), and must start signing up to be a Dasher using your unique link.\nIf eligible to be referred, your friend will see a blue banner at the top of their signup page and throughout their application process. To start dashing toward the referral bonus, your friend must successfully complete onboarding to become a Dasher. Referral offers are refreshed weekly and are subject to change, so timeliness is encouraged to make sure your offer is locked in.\n\nOnce activated, you and your friend will earn bonuses once they\u2019ve completed the required number of deliveries in their area, within the timeframe specified in their offer. \n  I am unable to refer others currently. When will I be able to refer friends?\n\nDashers in good standing who have completed 30 deliveries and have been dashing for at least 30 days, who have also passed our quality checks will be eligible to refer friends and family to dash. Quality checks are done to ensure a Dasher is in good standing (ie Dasher is not sharing accounts, not engaging in fraud, and has not been flagged for suspicious behavior or incomplete deliveries while Dashing). Referral eligibility is reviewed periodically by our team. Referral bonuses are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. Sometimes, there may not be an active referral offer in your area, but rest assured we will let you know when there\u2019s a new referral opportunity available to you! \n\n   \n\n\n  \nHow can I track the progress of my referrals?\n\nFrom the referrals page, click on the \u201cCheck status\u201d button to view your active referrals. You will be able to see how many deliveries your friends have done toward their referrals and also be able to check in on them to encourage their progress.\n  . \nMy friend sees a different offer than the one I initially referred them under. Why might these be different? \n\nReferral offers are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. The in-progress referrals on the Referrals page reflect offers that are locked in when your friend completes their signup to be a Dasher.  \n\nIn some cases, offers might get refreshed between the time you send a link and when your friend successfully becomes a Dasher.\n\nYour friend may also see a different offer if they are located in a different city and have opted to dash there. You will both receive the bonus tied to the offer they\u2019ve selected.\n\nAll Dasher referrals are governed by terms and conditions that can be found below.\nREFERRAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n\n ",

A Hotspot is an area within your Dashing starting point that indicates the busiest areas for orders. You will generally see Hotspots near areas with many restaurants. To increase your chances to receive more orders, simply position yourself closer to a Hotspot. Hotspots are meant to guide you to busy areas and they are consistently refreshed throughout the day, but they do not guarantee orders. \nYou can only see hotspots on your Dasher map while dashing and they will be displayed as a circle with a flame icon. Please see below for the two different types of Hotspots you may encounter.\n\nDynamic hotspots\nDynamic hotspots are created when a certain restaurant or area currently has a lot of orders. Dynamic hotspots will have a red area around it highlighting the full area of busy restaurants and will say \u201cBusy hotspot zone\u201d at the bottom of the screen. You do not have to be within the red area to receive an order, but the closer you get the more likely you are to get an order. \n\n  Historical Hotspots\nHistorical hotspots are shown as the flame icon without the red area around them and say \u201cPreviously busy Hotspot zone\u201d at the bottom of the screen. You will see historical Hotspots when it isn\u2019t busy enough to create a dynamic Hotspot. These Hotspots are based on recent data and guide you to restaurants that are usually busy at that time. \nFrequently Asked Questions \nQ: What should I do if I am being told there are no Hotspots available?\nA: If the Dasher app is telling you there are no Hotspots available, your app is still working and you can still receive orders. This just means there isn\u2019t any location that is busy enough to create a Hotspot.\nDuring these times, it is best to head to your favorite area to wait for orders.\nQ: How often do Hotspots update?\nA: Hotspots will update as different restaurants become busy and will refresh every 10 minutes. You can follow them, but areas that have recently been Hotspots often remain good areas to receive orders.\nThe Dasher app will show you the Hotspot closest to you by default, but you can scroll through other nearby Hotspots at the bottom of the screen.",

You\u2019ll know that it\u2019s a large order when you see \u2018Catering Bag Required\u2019 on the acceptance screen. This is part of a broader effort to improve the assignment process for high-value deliveries.\nYou\u2019ll still have priority access to these high-value orders \u2014 just for being a valuable part of our Large Order program.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions: \n  Q: Why can I no longer claim deliveries the prior day?\nA: Starting June 2, Drive deliveries will only be offered as you\u2019re out on your regular dash and can no longer be pre-claimed.\nQ: I\u2019ve not seen any orders available to claim in the scheduled tab for the past X weeks. Was I removed from the program?\nA: Nope, you\u2019ve not been removed from the program. You\u2019re still eligible to receive Drive catering deliveries, they\u2019ll just be offered in real-time. You may have seen an icon that looks like this in the accept modal as you\u2019re dashing:\n  Q: Do I still have priority access to catering deliveries?\nA: Yes, you\u2019ll still receive priority access to catering delivery opportunities \u2014 just for being a valuable part of our Large Order program. Dashers in this program are first in line to receive high-value catering delivery opportunities.\nQ: How can I tell which deliveries are catering with the new process?\nA: These deliveries will let you know to bring your catering bag with you into the restaurant to complete and will look similar to the below in your Dasher accept modal:\n  Q: What advantages do I receive with Large Orders?\nA: Large Orders pay on average 2-3X that of a normal marketplace delivery. And you\u2019ve still got preferential access to receive these delivery offers. Be on the lookout for this icon in the accept modal to flag these larger delivery offers. \n \nQ: Why are you making this change?\nA: Over the past couple of months, we received numerous reports from Dashers that our pre-claimed system is not functioning as intended. In order to improve your overall dashing experience, we will be moving Drive deliveries to a more effective assignment algorithm.\n\nQ: Why am I not able to view my Drive ratings page? \nA: The separate Drive ratings page has been removed as part of a broader effort to improve the assignment process. Ratings for Large Order deliveries will now be included together with your overall delivery rating. Starting June 2nd, you will start to notice that more of these Drive deliveries are being offered in real-time as you dash. You will continue to get priority access to these Large Order deliveries over regular dashers\nQ: Will you still use my ratings to determine which window I can pre-claim Drive deliveries?\nA: No, Dashers will no longer be able to pre-claim deliveries as they will all be offered real-time.\nQ: I would like to know more about the Large Order Program\nA: To learn more about the Drive LOF Program, please visit our Dasher Help Center article by clicking here.\n ",

This can be influenced by a variety of factors. Here are a few things to consider that may help improve your experience.\n\nTips to Help You Get More Deliveries\nStay Mobile: Changing your location can sometimes make a difference. If your current spot is slow, consider moving to different areas where you have previously had success. There is also a higher chance of getting orders if you move closer to restaurants.\nCheck Your Preferences: Make sure that your account preferences are set to maximize your delivery opportunities. It\u2019s a good idea to periodically review your settings to ensure they align with your current availability and capabilities.\nCheck Your Equipment: Certain orders may require you to have a Red Card (US only) or the correct type of vehicle. For instance, you might not receive an order if you are on a bicycle and the order requires a car. Double-check that you have all the necessary equipment to meet the delivery needs of stores in your area.\nStay Updated: Keep your app up-to-date to ensure that you're receiving all potential delivery requests. An outdated app can sometimes lead to unexpected issues.\nBe Available During Peak Times: Aligning your schedule with known busy periods can increase your chances of receiving more delivery requests.\nBy staying flexible and keeping an eye on how market conditions affect delivery volumes, you'll be better prepared to make the most of your time dashing.\n\nIf you think there is something wrong with your phone or Dasher app, please click the link for the app troubleshooting guide linked below.\nHOW CAN I FIND HOTSPOTS IN MY AREA?\nHOW DO I GET MORE ORDERS?\nTROUBLESHOOTING THE DASHER APP",

        "page_content": "Delivering Tobacco Guidelines\nDoorDash does not currently allow Merchants to directly sell tobacco products, electronic cigarettes, or other similar products on our consumer-facing Marketplace platform.\nHowever, in some states, provinces, and territories where it is legal, Merchants with a tobacco-specific agreement with DoorDash may request Dasher delivery of tobacco products that customers have purchased directly from the Merchant through the Merchant\u2019s own channels or through other platforms.  \nThe following information is intended to help you responsibly and lawfully deliver tobacco products in those circumstances.  Please note that you could be held liable if you deliver tobacco products to a minor, so it's important that you follow this process fully to protect yourself, the customer, and the health and safety of minors.  As a reminder, you are free to decline any delivery offer, including tobacco deliveries.\nI. TOBACCO PRODUCT PICK-UP\nTobacco orders are age-restricted in accordance with local law.  In order to pick up a tobacco order, you will be required to present your valid driver's license or another valid government-issued ID, so please make sure you have your ID on you before accepting the order.\n\nII. TOBACCO PRODUCT DROP-OFF\nA. AGE AND ID VERIFICATION\nYou can only deliver tobacco products to a customer if the customer meets the minimum age requirement under local law:\n21+ in the U.S.\n18+ in Australia; or \n18, 19, or 21+ in Canada in accordance with provincial law.\nTo verify age, ask the customer to see a valid ID.  Check every customer\u2019s ID every time, even if the customer clearly appears to be over the legally-required age.  A valid ID must include a photograph and date of birth.  For example, acceptable forms of ID may include:\nA valid driver's license or identification card issued by federal, state, provincial, county, or municipal government.\nA valid passport.\nAn identification card issued by the Armed Forces of the United States that contains the name, date of birth, description, and picture of the person.\nNext, make sure the ID is not invalid or fake:\nCheck the expiration date. Do not accept an ID that is expired.\nAsk to remove the ID from the wallet.\nCompare the customer at the door to the photo in the ID.  Examine facial features: are the height, eye shape, ear and nose shape or placement similar?  Ignore weight, hair and makeup as these may change.\nFeel the edges of the ID - a legitimate ID will have smooth, uniform edges.  A fake ID may have rougher edges and perhaps may be coming apart.\nLook for glue lines or bumpy or uneven surfaces. A real ID\u2019s surface should be consistent.\nIf the customer\u2019s ID check fails your physical examination or an app-prompted ID scan, do not complete the delivery; instead, return the tobacco product(s) to the merchant.\n\nB. RESTRICTED LOCATIONS\nDo NOT, under any circumstances, deliver tobacco products to the following locations:\nPublic or private school (K-12) (e.g. an elementary school);\nHospitals & health care facilities;\nSports venues or any place hosting a sporting event;\nCollege campus (e.g. a fraternity house, residence hall, library);\nPrison, reformatory, veterans\u2019 home, or state capitol grounds;\nP.O. Boxes;\nLocker or similar package storage service (e.g. a storage facility); or\nOther business that sells tobacco products (e.g. tobacco retail shop).\nC.  JUDGMENT\nLastly, use your judgment. If you have any doubts about the ID or the customer, or encounter a situation in which it does not seem reasonable to deliver a tobacco product (e.g., a location where minors are present and appear to be the intended recipients), do not complete delivery and contact support.\nIII. DECLINE CUSTOMER-INITIATED REQUESTS FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS\nIf a customer reaches out to you directly (e.g., via the in-app chat feature or by phone) to request that you add a tobacco product to their order, it is important to decline the request.  Third party delivery of tobacco products is illegal in many states.  Even in states where tobacco delivery is legal, initiating the delivery outside of normal processes violates DoorDash\u2019s Consumer Terms and Dasher Policies, and could also unintentionally result in a noncompliant delivery - e.g., a delivery without an ID check and/or without collection of a signature upon delivery.  Declining the request will protect you, the merchant, the customer, and DoorDash.  If the customer is insistent with their request, you can always contact support for assistance.\n ",

        "page_content": "Delivering Alcohol Guidelines\nAlcohol Orders:\nAlcohol delivery for DoorDash has expanded to reach the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. \n\nAlcohol delivery is optional, and opting out of this type of delivery will not impact your ability to receive other orders from restaurants, grocery stores, retail partners, and more. If you wish to opt-out of this type of delivery, please submit your request to support@doordash.com. In addition, if you ever receive an alcohol order you do not wish to perform, you have the option to decline the order before accepting it or cancel the order before picking it up from the merchant.\nAlcohol Delivery:\nWhile on a dash, you may see orders containing alcoholic beverages, and the following information is intended to help you lawfully deliver alcohol with DoorDash. You could be held liable if you deliver alcohol to a minor or someone who is visibly intoxicated or if you leave the alcohol unattended, so it\u2019s important that you know what to do to protect yourself and the consumer.\n\nImportant reminders:\nYou must check the recipient\u2019s identity by following instructions in the Dasher app before you hand them an order containing alcohol. You will be prompted to scan ID and also visually compare the recipient\u2019s appearance to the ID they provide. You cannot leave an alcohol order unattended or hand it to someone else who cannot produce a valid ID.\nDashers cannot consume alcohol prior to or while dashing\u2014or be under the influence of anything.\nDashers must be of legal drinking age (21+) and have a valid government-issued ID to deliver orders containing alcohol. Have your ID ready when you pick up the order\u2014merchants will ask for it. \nThis is serious business. You may be held criminally liable if you provide alcohol to a person who is underage or intoxicated or leave alcohol unattended.\n\nLiability for an unlawful alcohol delivery may include:\nFines or jail time.\nCivil lawsuits that individuals may bring against delivery persons to recover damages for personal injury or property resulting from an unlawful alcohol delivery, which typically results in a monetary fine (but a criminal action can result in jail time).\nDoorDash may also take such other remedial action up to and including deactivation from the DoorDash platform. Remember, we\u2019re here to support you! If you have any questions before, during, or after a dash, get in touch with us through the Dasher app.\nThe following is the Dasher\u2019s guide in Delivering Alcohol.\nDasher requirements\nHow do I know if the order contains alcohol? \nKey delivery rules to remember \nHow to verify the consumer\u2019s identity\nPreventing delivery to underage consumers \nWhy staying compliant matters \nPreventing delivery to intoxicated consumers \nHow to refuse delivery \nWhat to do with undeliverable orders\nNew Jersey Dasher Requirements\nAppendix: step-by-step instructions\nDasher requirements\nDashers must be of legal drinking age and have a valid government-issued ID to deliver orders containing alcohol. Have your ID ready when you pick up the order\u2014merchants will ask for it.\n\nDashers must complete required education modules in specific states. Without completing such a module, it is illegal to complete deliveries. You can access the required module through your Dasher app under your \u2018Profile\u2019.\n  How do I know if the order contains alcohol?\nYou'll see a notice on the screen indicating the order contains restricted items, including alcohol.\nOnce you click \u201cAccept'', the Dasher app will include the steps required to deliver alcohol safely and compliantly in accordance with applicable state law.\n\n  Key delivery rules to remember\nDon't accept additional orders or special requests for alcohol directly from the consumers (for example, if they reach out via text or message you in the app)\nDon't leave an order unattended for a consumer to collect. You must deliver the order in person, scan a valid form of ID, and then do a physical examination of the ID, all before handing over the order to the recipient.\nUse your best judgment. Remember, you can always refuse to deliver if a person appears below the legal drinking age but presents an ID saying they are older or, if they are of legal drinking age, but are at a location with several other persons who appear under the age. Circumstances matter, so be vigilant, especially when near locations with persons typically under the legal drinking age, such as college campuses.\n\nRestricted locations\nPublic or private school (K-12) (such as an elementary school);\nCollege campus (including a fraternity or sorority house);\nPrison, reformatory, veterans\u2019 home, or state capitol grounds;\nLocker or similar package storage service (such as a storage facility); or\nBusiness that sells alcohol (like a grocery or liquor store).\nIf you arrive at a consumer\u2019s address with an alcohol order, and you see that the address is, or you reasonably suspect that it is, one of the above locations, you are empowered to refuse delivery. Follow the \u201cCan\u2019t complete delivery\u201d instructions in your Dasher app which will guide you on what to do with the alcohol.\n  How to verify the consumer\u2019s identity\n(Remember: you must verify the consumer\u2019s identity and that they are over the legal drinking age before handing them the order)\n\nFollow the steps in the Dasher app. Upon delivery, you\u2019ll be prompted to scan the recipient\u2019s physical ID, which looks like this:\n    \nTo the extent the scan is successful and the app indicates that the ID is valid, then do a physical examination of the ID to ensure that it is valid and that it matches the recipient. Take a close and long look \u2014 make sure the person on the ID is the same person you\u2019re handing the order to, that the ID is not expired, does not display any evidence of fraud (more details on that below), and is for an individual over the legal drinking age. Only hand over the alcohol after having successfully completed these two ID checks.\n\nNote: In states that require a signature, you\u2019ll also be prompted to collect the consumer\u2019s signature.\n\nThere are 4 valid, acceptable forms of ID:\nState ID Card or Driver\u2019s License\nU.S. Military ID\nU.S. Passport\nForeign Country Passport\nThese are INVALID, non-acceptable forms of ID:\nNon-government ID (ex. college ID or work ID)\nCredit Card\nPrinted copy or photo of an ID\nExpired IDs\nWhat to check a physical ID for:\nCheck the photo and physical description to make sure they match the consumer.\nConfirm both the expiration date and the consumer\u2019s date of birth.\nFor physical IDs, hold it to see if it\u2019s been tampered with or if it looks like a fake.\nSome things to consider for confirming a valid physical ID:\nSome states use raised text or embossed elements that you can feel on valid IDs.\nA valid ID will NOT include images of a lock or key. \nIn some states, a valid ID can also include holographic images. These 3D images change when the ID is viewed at different angles.\nHow to spot a fake:\nThe edges of a valid ID should be smooth and uniform, whereas the edges of a fake ID may be rougher or coming apart.\nValid identification should NOT include words like 'genuine', 'souvenir', 'official', 'novelty' or 'authentic'.\nIf the lamination is split, thin, or has bubbles, it may have been tampered with.\nSeverely damaged IDs should not be accepted.\nRemember, you can always refuse to deliver if a person appears below the legal drinking age but presents an ID saying they are older.\n  Preventing Delivery to Underage Customers\nRules in the United States\n\nBy law, you must be 21 years or older to purchase, possess, or consume alcohol.\nPeople under the legal drinking age may not purchase or receive alcohol.\nPeople of the legal drinking age or older may not purchase alcohol on behalf of someone under the legal drinking age.\nWhy staying compliant matters\nBe sure to follow the law. If a delivery person makes an illegal alcohol delivery, they may be personally liable. Fines or jail time can be issued to you by government authorities, and individuals may bring lawsuits against a delivery person to recover damages for personal injury or property.\n\nRemember, we\u2019re here to support you! If you have any questions before, during, or after a dash, get in touch with us through the Dasher app.\nPreventing Delivery to Intoxicated Customers\nIt's illegal to serve someone alcohol who is already intoxicated. The law requires that alcohol SHOULD NOT be delivered to a consumer who appears to be intoxicated with any substance (such as alcohol or cannabis, for example).\nHere are some common signs that someone\u2019s had too much to drink:\nLook for glassy or bloodshot eyes or if someone clearly has difficulty keeping their eyes open.\nIf you notice that the person\u2019s breath or clothes smell of alcohol, this may be an effective tell-tale sign of intoxication.\nIf someone is having trouble walking in a straight line or is fumbling with objects, this may be a sign that they are intoxicated.\nUse your best judgment.\nHow to refuse delivery\nYour right to refuse delivery\nIf you suspect someone is underage or intoxicated, you ALWAYS have the right to refuse delivery of alcohol. \nIf no one is home to accept an order, you must not complete the delivery.\nIf you are suspicious that the recipient is using a fake ID, do not deliver alcohol products to them. \nIf you suspect that the consumer is accepting the delivery on behalf of someone else who is underage, you must refuse delivery. \nHow to refuse delivery\nPolitely tell the consumer that you cannot deliver the alcohol.\nFollow the instructions in your Dasher app which will guide you on what to do with the alcohol.\nShould a potentially tricky situation arise, get to a safe location and call the police \nWhat to do with undeliverable orders\n\nWhat if no one is home?\nAlcohol cannot, under ANY circumstances, be left unattended at a consumer\u2019s door.\nFollow the \"consumer unavailable\u201d instructions and the Dasher app will prompt you to return the alcohol to the store.\nNew Jersey Dasher Requirements\nDelivery Worker (i.e., each Dasher) acknowledges that, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 33:1-35 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act (\"ABC Act\"), as an independent contractor providing contracted services through the DoorDash Platform, governed by the DoorDash Independent Contractor Agreement and the Delivering Alcohol Guidelines included therein, he or she is required to cooperate with inspections and investigations conducted by any authorized representative of the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (\"NJABC\"), upon presentation of credentials, and to provide documentation or other items and information upon demand in accordance with the requirements of this permit, the ABC Act and regulations. Delivery Worker agrees to fully cooperate with any inspection or investigation by NJABC. Failure to cooperate with an inspection or investigation may result in administrative charges being issued against the Permittee (i.e., DoorDash).   \nDelivery Worker acknowledges that DoorDash is required to terminate its agreement for alcohol delivery with any Delivery Worker who violates this permit (i.e., DoorDash's third party alcohol delivery permit), the ABC Act or regulations.\nAppendix: step-by-step guide\nCheck out this step-by-step guide below to navigating orders in-app\u2014you\u2019ll see exactly what the deliveries look like as well as the steps to complete a compliant, successful delivery.\n\nHow to tell if the order contains alcohol?\n\nYou'll see a notice on the screen indicating the order contains restricted items, including alcohol. When you accept, be sure to have your ID ready to present to the Merchant when picking up the order. Note that Dashers must be at the legal drinking age and have a valid government-issued ID to deliver orders containing alcohol.\n    Drop-off instructions\nWhen delivering alcohol, you must follow each step in the Dasher app. You\u2019ll be prompted to scan the customer\u2019s ID and verify their identity BEFORE you hand over the alcohol. In states that require a signature, the Dasher app will prompt you to collect the customer\u2019s signature before you hand over the alcohol.\n    \n  Scan the customer\u2019s ID and verify the customer\u2019s identity.\n\nFollow the instructions in the Dasher app to scan the customer\u2019s ID and verify that the ID matches the person you\u2019re delivering the alcohol to. Confirm by tapping \u2018Verify\u2019. If you cannot confirm, tap \u2018Can\u2019t verify\u2019 and follow the instructions in the Dasher app. \n       If you\u2019re prompted in the Dasher app, collect the customer\u2019s signature.\n \n  Complete the delivery.\n    NOTE: For orders that cannot be delivered (for example, if the Customer is unavailable, underage, or intoxicated), you will be prompted to return the order to the store for additional return pay.\n  \nAccept and Complete Deliveries\nAccess Special Order Types\nAlcohol Orders\n ",

        "page_content": "What is a Pharmacy Delivery?\n\nPharmacy deliveries are for prescription medication. They operate just like a normal delivery, with a few important differences. \n\nFrequently Asked Questions: \nQ: Am I eligible to deliver prescriptions?\nA: Yes! At this time, all Dashers are eligible to deliver prescriptions. Please note the following unique protocols about sealed packaging when completing pharmacy orders:\nSealed Packages \nAll prescription deliveries should be in sealed, non-transparent packages (so you won\u2019t be able to see the contents).\nPackages should be sealed by the pharmacy and opened only by the customer out of respect for their privacy. You may request tamper-proof packaging if the pharmacy doesn't seal the package.\nIf the pharmacy hands you a damaged or see-through package, you may remind them that sealed, non-transparent packaging is required. Contact DoorDash Support if you need additional assistance. \nQ: How do I know this is a prescription delivery? \nA: You\u2019ll know if you received a prescription delivery request because the pickup instructions will direct you to go to the pharmacy counter to pick up the prescription.\nThere are two layers of acceptance on pharmacy orders. After accepting the order, you\u2019ll also receive an informational \u201cpop-up\u201d that provides information and pharmacy expectations around privacy. At this time, you can either acknowledge the information or unassign from the order.\nQ: What if I do not want to accept a prescription delivery?\nA: You do not have to accept any deliveries that you do not want to deliver.\nQ: What do I do when I get to the customer? \nA: Your Dasher App will prompt you to follow one of the following protocols: \nSignature Capture: Your Dasher App might prompt you to capture a signature and details about the person signing. When a signature is required upon delivery and if an adult is not available to sign, marking \u201cCustomer Unavailable\u201d in the Dasher app automatically creates a return delivery. The app will provide information about where and how to return the prescription to the pharmacy. You will receive compensation if you have to complete a return.\nUnattended Delivery: When a signature is not required, marking \u201cCustomer Unavailable\u201d in the Dasher app will begin a 5-minute timer to give you time to find the customer. At the end of the timer, your app will prompt you to leave the order in a safe location and document where you left the order with a photo and description. If there is no safe place to leave the order, you may chat DoorDash Support so an agent can help you.   \nContactless Delivery: Your Dasher App might prompt you to keep the delivery contactless at the request of the customer. Your app will prompt you to leave the order in a safe location and document where you left the order with a photo and description. If there is no safe place to leave the order, you may chat DoorDash Support so an agent can help you.\nWhat happens if there is an issue on the order?\nWrong Customer Address: Return the prescription to the pharmacy (you will be compensated for this return!) Chat DoorDash Support with any issues. \nPackage is damaged: Return the prescription to the pharmacy (you will be compensated for this return!). Chat DoorDash Support with any issues. \nTechnical/App Issue: If you have any technical issues, please chat DoorDash Support so an agent can help you.  \nStore closed upon return: If the pharmacy is closed, see if there is a store manager present. If not, chat DoorDash Support to confirm next steps! ",

        "page_content": "Dasher Ratings Explained\nUnless otherwise notified in writing, the minimum rating threshold(s) for Dashers can be found in the chart below:\nRating Minimum Required\nCustomer Rating 4.2\nCompletion Rate 90%\nAcceptance Rate No Minimum\nOn-time/Early Rate Repeated lateness may result in deactivation\n\nOverview\nAs a Dasher, you\u2019ll receive ratings that help you track the quality of the service you provide on the platform. Ratings determine if you\u2019re eligible to dash, and can also help you qualify for certain programs and incentives.\n\nSome ratings are calculated on a \u201crolling basis.\u201d This means that as you dash, ratings from past offers will be replaced by ratings from more recent offers \u2014 while other ratings are calculated across all your offers. The graphic below helps illustrate how these rolling ratings work. This specific example uses Acceptance Rate, but the same calculation is applied for Completion Rate, as well as Customer Rating:\nAs a Dasher accepts more offers, the oldest offers are removed. More recent declines will take longer than older declines to be pushed out of the last 100 deliveries used for the calculation. This is why, if a Dasher maintains a high Acceptance Rate, with few declines in their last 100, it may take a large number of accepted offers in a row to remove the small number of declines that exist in the total 100 last offers.\n\nCustomer Rating\nThe overall Customer Rating is a score from 1-5, calculated from the 100 most recent ratings submitted by customers on their offer (not food) experience. This is called a \u201crolling average,\u201d because new scores replace old scores, allowing Dashers to improve their rating by \u201cpushing out\u201d older lower scores with newer higher scores over time. This means that even if you drop below a 5.0, you can get back up to 5.0 if you continue to earn enough 5-star ratings.\n\nRemember that customers rate their food and their Dasher separately, so your ratings should only reflect the customer\u2019s delivery experience. You can see your current ratings and how they are calculated at any time in the Dasher App in the Ratings tab.\n\nTo help make ratings more fair, we remove any Customer Ratings you receive that are below 5 stars in the following circumstances:\nLong wait times at restaurants (>10 minutes)\nWhen the delivery or task is already expected to be >15 minutes late when you accept it \nWhen multiple Dashers before you unassign, causing you to be >15 minutes late \nWhen the delivery or task is late due to multiple batched offers (3 or more)\nExtreme weather conditions (e.g., snowstorms)\nUniquely challenging dashing situations related to protests (at this time, including Customer Rating, Acceptance Rate, and Completion Rate)\nSystem-wide outages (including Acceptance and Completion Rate)\nFor other app issues, please see our troubleshooting guide here\nThese adjustments happen automatically. Thank you for your continued efforts to provide services to your customers using the DoorDash platform.\n\nFAQs: \nQ: Why doesn\u2019t my overall rating go up even when I complete a great offer?\nA: Your Customer Rating does not include offers in which the customer did not leave a rating. Therefore if you've received 100 ratings so far, and your next offer does not receive a rating from the customer, your rating will remain the same.\n\nQ: I didn\u2019t do any offers recently but my rating changed?\nA: Customers may not always immediately leave a rating, so there may be times when your Customer Rating changes well after the offer has been completed. This will likely be why you see your Customer Rating change even if you have not made any offers.\n\nQ: What is the minimum Customer Rating required?\nA: Dashers may be deactivated from the DoorDash platform if they have a Customer Rating below 4.2.\nQ: How do I improve my average Customer Rating?\nA: Dashers may be deactivated from the DoorDash platform if they have a customer rating below 4.2.\n\nQ: How do I improve my average Consumer rating?\nA: We can share a number of tips that could help you improve your rating, but do what works best for you. We encourage you to test different things to see what fits you. Here are a few tips that experienced Dashers use to maintain a high Customer Rating:\nAsk the merchant to confirm all items are included but do not open sealed bags.\nUse a hot bag to deliver meals at the expected temperature to customers.\nSeparate hot and cold items during transport so they don\u2019t impact one another.\nNote and follow the merchant\u2019s pickup instructions and the customer\u2019s drop-off instructions.\nKeep the customer updated! Customers always appreciate a heads-up when you\u2019re running a few minutes late or if any clarification is needed for the offer.\nCompletion Rate\nYour Completion Rate is the percentage of deliveries or tasks completed out of the 100 most recent offers you accept. You can increase your Completion Rate by making sure every offer you accept is delivered to the customer. If you unassign in the middle of an offer you accepted, that could impact your Completion Rate.\n\nAssuming a Dasher has accepted at least 100 offers, every additional new accepted offer will bump out the oldest accepted offer. If the latest accepted offer is completed but the oldest accepted offer was also completed, then your overall average will not change. However, if the latest accepted offer is completed and the oldest accepted offer is not completed, then you will see your average increase. Conversely, if the latest accepted offer is not completed but the oldest accepted offer is completed, then the average will decrease.\n\nOnce you have passed 100 lifetime deliveries, each additional offer will only have a 1% impact on your average.\n\nFAQs: \nQ: What if the customer or merchant cancels the offer?\nA: Offers canceled by a Customer or Merchant are counted as completed offers for purposes of your completion rate. Your completion rate decreases only if you unassign yourself from an accepted offer, or if you call in to Support to request unassignment from an accepted offer. \n\nQ: What if I have an emergency and can\u2019t complete an offer?\nA: We understand that things happen -- your car dies or you have a family situation. That\u2019s why you only need to maintain a minimum completion rate of 90% in order to keep your account on the platform. If you have an emergency during an offer and need to report it, contact Support.\n\nQ: I am completing deliveries \u2014 why isn't my Completion Rate going up?\nA: Completion Rate is calculated from only the last 100 offers that you accepted. This means that it can take a large number of completed offers in a row before you see an improvement. If your Completion Rate is 94%, that means you only have 6 uncompleted offers in your last 100 accepted offers. In order to raise your rating, you will need to complete every accepted offer until you push one of those 6 uncompleted offers out of your most recent 100. As you can imagine, the fewer uncompleted offers you have in your last 100, the longer it can take to raise your Completion Rate. If your score is already high, there are only so many unassigns to \u201cpush out\u201d of your calculation in order to raise it. A visual example of how this works can be found here.\n\nQ: What is the minimum completion rate required?\nA: You are required to complete 90% of the offers you accept to remain on the platform. If you are approaching the lower completion rate limit, you will receive a text message that says \u201cYour Completion Rate must be above 90% to remain active as a Dasher.\u201d \nQ: Will my ratings be affected if I unassign from an offer?\nA: Unassigning from an offer affects a Dasher\u2019s Completion Rate, you will receive a notification on your app when you accept an offer but later unassign from it. It will also notify you that completion rates below 90% could result in account deactivation.\nQ: If I am unassigned by support, will it affect my completion rating?\nA: Yes, if you unassign yourself from an accepted offer, either via self-help or by contacting support, your Completion Rate will be affected.\n\n\nAcceptance Rate\nAcceptance Rate is the percentage of deliveries you accepted out of the 100 most recent offers you receive. You can raise your acceptance rate by consistently accepting offers that are offered to you. It is also a \u201crolling average,\u201d which means it may take a few offers before you see an increase in your average.\n\nThere is no minimum requirement for an acceptance rate, but consistently declining offers negatively impact the experience for other Dashers (who will have less time to complete the offer), the customer (who is more likely to get a late delivery or task), and even the merchant (whose food will sit for longer). \nFAQs\nQ: I am accepting deliveries but why isn't my Acceptance Rate going up?\nA: Acceptance Rate is calculated from only the last 100 offers. This means that it can take several accepted offers before you see an improvement because every additional new offer will bump out only the oldest offer. If your Acceptance Rate is 80%, that means you only have 20 declined offers in your last 100 offers. In order to raise your rating, you will need to accept every offer until you push one of those 20 declines out of your most recent 100 offers. As you can imagine, the fewer declines you have in your last 100, the longer it can take to raise your Acceptance Rate. A visual example of how this works can be found here. The best way to push out declined orders from your score is to consistently accept offers. \nQ: If I let the timer run out, does it still count as declining?\nA: If the timer runs out it will count as declining an order and will be reflected in your Acceptance Rate. Remember that you can pause your dash if you are unable to accept opportunities.  You can learn more about ratings in our Dasher\nQ: Does declining an offer affect my ratings?\nA: Dashers can always decline an offer opportunity. You will see a notification appear if you decline an order assignment giving you a heads-up that your acceptance rate may drop. \n  On-time/Early Rate \nYour on-time/early rate is a percentage based on the number of orders you have completed by the estimated delivery time (or 5 minutes past)\nWhile there is currently no minimum requirement for an on-time/early rate, Dashers are responsible for making sure that deliveries they choose to accept are completed on time. In agreeing to the Independent Contractor Agreement Dashers agree to \u201ccomplete delivery orders to consumers in a safe and timely fashion.\u201c\nTherefore, regardless of their overall On-time/Early rate, Dashers who arrive at the merchant or customer significantly after estimated pick-up or drop-off times will be eligible for deactivation of their account for violating the terms of their ICA.\n\nDrive Ratings \nQ: Is there a separate rating for Drive offers?\nA: Ratings for Large Order deliveries or Drive will now be included together with your overall offer rating. \nQ: Why am I not able to view my Drive rating page? \nA: The separate Drive ratings page has been removed as part of a broader effort to improve the assignment process. Starting June 2, 2022, you will start to notice that more of these Drive deliveries are being offered in real-time as you dash. You will continue to get priority access to these Large Order deliveries over regular Dashers",

While the app is pretty good about tracking where the dasher is, there are times when customers get impatient. On a normal order, I text when I have the order and what my ETA is.  I am sure to communicate with customers anytime the merchant is taking longer than expected, are out of a requested item, when I have multiple orders to drop off, basically anytime something comes up that may affect the customer, let them know. - Randy, Dasher, Castle Rock CO, 4000+ deliveries\n  Send a courtesy text when at the restaurant and let the customer know if there is any wait or if any item is unavailable. Communication plays a major factor and can ultimately lead to a larger tip and better ratings. -  Jonathan, Dasher, Fort Drum NY,  2000+ deliveries\n  When you arrive at the restaurant, send a courtesy text to let the customer know you have received their order pick up request and advise them of any expected wait times or possible delays... Communication is the major tool. Ratings and tips will be impacted by more communication with the customers such as \u201c I\u2019m on the way\u201d or \u201c my GPS says I should be there in 14 minutes.\u201d - Brian, Dasher, Vancouver BC, 2000+ deliveries\n  Use a communication method that works for the customer. If you send a text message and get no response, call the customer. Not everyone embraces text messaging as much as we do... I use templates because that way I don\u2019t have to worry about autocorrects before I send it. It\u2019s easier and quicker when I copy and paste. - Kari, Dasher, Killeen TX, 2000+ deliveries\n  \n\nFor inspiration, below are examples of text templates that actual Top Dashers use during deliveries that you could adapt for your own use.\n  During pickup:\nThere\u2019s a little wait time at the restaurant on orders, as soon as I get your order I will text you with a live ETA.\nHello, this is your Dasher.

Read on for FAQs, answered by the Everlance team.\n\nWhat is Everlance and why should I use it?\nEverlance is an app that automatically tracks your mileage, expenses, and income and is designed to help independent contractors maximize their tax deductions (which means you get to keep more of your hard-earned money).\n\nWhy should I track my expenses as a Dasher?\nSimple answer - to save money! As an independent worker, you can \u201cdeduct\u201d business expenses from your taxes. Deducting those expenses reduces how much you pay in taxes and increases how much money you get to keep.\n\nWhat business expenses can I deduct as a Dasher?\nIf you use a car to dash, that\u2019s probably your biggest business expense: every 100 miles is worth over $54 on your taxes! Even if you don\u2019t use a car for deliveries on the DoorDash platform, there are many other business expenses you can deduct: your phone, your data plan, your ride, your health insurance, your hot bags, and many more. The more you deduct, the more money you keep.\n\nWhat else can Everlance help with?\nAs an app that specializes in helping people track mileage and expenses for taxes, Everlance has lots of easy-to-understand, educational resources on taxes, from understanding taxes for independent contractors, to discovering business deductions, to deciphering your 1099 tax form.\n\nHow can I get help with Everlance?\nCheck out Everlance\u2019s Help Center or contact Everlance\u2019s awesome Support Team at support@everlance.com.",

In order to help ensure smooth and safe pickups, merchants will provide any new pick-up instructions in the Dasher app. Please pay special attention to these notes, as they may change frequently.

If you receive a sealed bag, both customers and restaurants require that you do not open the package - even to check the contents. If you want to verify the order, confirm the name and its contents with the restaurant staff.\n\nQ: How can I report a merchant as closed?\nA: If a restaurant appears closed, please check for a pick-up window or the drive-through (when applicable).

How can I get help?\nHelp, my Red Card is not working!\n\nWhat is a Dasher Red Card?\nThe Red Card is a prepaid card that Dashers use to pay for items on Dasher Shop & Deliver offers. The card will automatically be funded when you go to check out for a shopping offer. Red Cards are not linked to Dasher bank accounts or related to earnings.\nRed Cards can be:\nDigital - stored in the digital wallet in your phone (recommended)\nPhysical - physical card ordered from the DoorDash store\n\nWhy do I need a Red Card?\nDoorDash Shop & Deliver offers can only be completed with a Red Card. We suggest to make sure to bring a Red Card with you so that you can accept these offers and take advantage of every earning opportunity. Most merchants accept contactless payments so you will likely be able to check out with a digital card. If you are checking out at a merchant that does not accept contactless payments, you can use your physical Red Card if you have one. If you do not have a physical Red Card, you have the option to use your personal card, keep the receipt, and reach out to support for reimbursement. \n\nHow do I get a digital Red Card?\nIt\u2019s simple - it just takes a minute from your Dasher app\n\nFor iOS\nGo to the \u2018Account\u2019 tab of your Dasher app \nTap \u201cDasher Red Card\u201d\nTap \u201cAdd to Apple Wallet\u201d to get your card\nIf prompted to choose a device, select your phone name \nCard information will automatically populate\nAccept the Terms & Condition\nOnce successfully added, your \u2018Dasher Red Card\u2019 tab should show \u2018Active in Apple Wallet\u2019 \n\n\nFor Android\n1.

What does this mean?\nI received the 'Pre-Adverse Action Notice' email, what can I do?\nI received a'Post-Adverse Action Notice' email, what can I do?\n\nOverview\n\nAs part of our commitment to help protect the DoorDash community, we are constantly evaluating new ways to help promote safety on the platform. Anyone signing up to dash must pass a secure background check before gaining access to the DoorDash platform.\n\nMost Frequently Asked Questions\n\nQ: What is the process?\nA: DoorDash uses accredited third-party background check providers, including Checkr to run secure background checks on all prospective and existing Dashers. Background checks are initiated as part of the signup process, before allowing individuals to access the platform to accept offers as new Dashers. For the continued safety and security of all members of our community, background check reruns are performed under certain circumstances. This allows us to receive and evaluate potential new or updated criminal history records through real-time data sources.\n\nAdditionally, Checkr provides a continuous check feature that can report new offenses occurring after your initial complete background check.\n\nQ: What information is contained in a background check?\nA: Background checks consist of the following:\nMotor Vehicle Report (if using a motor vehicle to dash)\nCriminal History Report\n\nQ: What happens if I have a new record since my most recent background check report?\nA: If your report reflects an incident or information that results in you no longer meeting the background check criteria, your Dasher account will be deactivated from the platform. You will receive an email if this happens.\n\nQ: How does that process work and how long does it take?\nA: If such a record is flagged in your report, you will be notified with a Pre-Adverse Action notice attached to an email sent from no-reply@checkr.com before any deactivation action is taken. That notice will include a copy of your report and additional information, including how you can dispute the accuracy of any information in the background check or provide additional information to be considered. \n\nIf you do not provide any additional information, or dispute the accuracy of your background check with Checkr, within the number of days provided in your Pre-Adverse Action Notice, you will receive a Post-Adverse action notice that provides an explanation of the final decision, and your Dasher account will be deactivated.\n\nQ: How do I dispute the accuracy of my background check or provide more information for DoorDash to consider in its decision?\nA: All of the information needed to dispute the accuracy of background check with Checkr, or to provide additional information to Doordash for consideration, is contained in the Pre-Adverse Action notice attached to the email from no-reply@checkr.com. If you believe the findings of the Checkr report are inaccurate (e.g., the charge(s) listed are not your own, details of the charge are incorrect, out of date, etc.), please contact Checkr via their Checkr Candidate Portal. Through the candidate portal, please follow the dispute process which involves specifying what you believe to be inaccurate on your report and following the appropriate steps. For questions or assistance, please contact Checkr Support.\n\nQ: My background check is 'suspended'. What does that mean?\nA: This usually indicates that you need to provide Checkr with additional information or documentation in order for your background check to continue processing. You should have received an email from no-reply@checkr.com with instructions, or you can log into the Checkr Candidate Portal to view the status of your background check.\n\nQ: Why is my report taking such a long time?\nA: While most background checks are completed within a day, it is not uncommon to encounter longer wait times of one to two weeks due to factors such as DMV and local county office delays. Recall that process includes both a criminal background check and, for those who indicate they will deliver by motorized vehicle, a motor vehicle report check. Individuals who plan to deliver by bicycle do not need to undergo a motor vehicle report check. Please visit the Checkr Candidate Portal for the most up-to-date estimates.\n\nBecause the checks are performed by Checkr, not DoorDash, DoorDash is unable to expedite or provide estimated completion times. Contact Checkr Support if you have any further questions about processing times.\n\nQ: Checkr says my report is complete. Why can't I continue to sign up?\nA: Complete is a term that Checkr uses to indicate it has finished compiling the information on a report. A report being \u201cComplete\u201d is not an indication that the results of the search have been reviewed or of an individual\u2019s eligibility to access the DoorDash platform. In other words, not all \u201cComplete\u201d reports have been reviewed and received a \u201cClear\u201d status that would allow you to move on to the next step in the sign-up process. To check whether your completed report is \u201cClear\u201d or requires any additional action, please log in to the Checkr Candidate Portal.\n\nIf you opted to receive a copy of your background check or live in a state that requires a copy to be sent, you should have received an email from Checkr with the subject line \u201cYour DoorDash background check is complete!\u201d.\n\nQ: What does my background check status mean?\nA: The answer depends on which message you see when you sign in to your Dasher signup account. The following messages are what you should be looking for:\nClear\nClear: Your background check is clear and you are ready to move on to the next step in the sign-up process. You should have received an email from no-reply@checkr.com with the following message: \n\n\"Congratulations! This message means you have completed and cleared the background check step. Finish the next steps in the app to start dashing.\"\n\nPlease note: In certain locations, there may be a waitlist to start dashing right away, and you will need to wait for a welcome email from DoorDash\n\nIn Progress\nConsider: Your background check has been processed by Checkr and has been shared with us for internal review. Click here to view your current status. \n\nThe Consider status means that Checkr has processed your background check, but the results require additional review. \n\nReviews are typically completed within 5 business days. To see the results of your review and if you are eligible to Dash, please search your email inbox (the address associated with your Dasher signup) for an email with the subject \u2018Pre-Adverse Action Notice\u2019 or \u2018Post-Adverse Action Notice\u2019. \n\nPending: Your background check is still being processed by Checkr. Click here to view your current status with Checkr and whether they need additional information from you in order to complete your background check.\n\nSometimes Checkr may require additional information in order to complete the process. Please provide any additional information requested by Checkr by logging in to the Checkr Candidate Portal.\n\nIf Checkr has not requested any additional information  or if you have already submitted the requested information, this means your background check is still being processed by Checkr. DoorDash is unable to expedite or provide estimates on wait times, because the reports are compiled and completed by Checkr, not DoorDash. Please visit the Checkr Candidate Portal for the most up-to-date estimated completion time. For additional information regarding estimated completion times, please contact Checkr Support.\n\nDisputed: Your background check dispute is being reviewed by Checkr. Disputed background checks can take up to 30 days.\n\nIf you have disputed the results of a report with Checkr, then you may see this status. It means that Checkr has received your dispute and is reviewing it. Checkr requires up to 30 days to process disputes.\n\nQ: How can I check the status of my background check?\nA: The background check process varies, but it can take 5-7 business days and, in some instances, a bit longer. If you have questions about the status of your background check, you can reach out to Checkr for more information by:\nClicking on the link below and providing the phone number, email, social security number, and date of birth you used for your background check. Once you have provided the information, click the Get Status button.\nCheckr Candidate Portal\n\nQ: I received the 'Pre-Adverse Action Notice' email, what can I do?\nA: If you are:\n\nSigning up to become a Dasher:\n\nIf you received an email with the subject 'Pre-Adverse Action Notice', this means that based on the information in your background check report, you may be precluded from proceeding with the sign up process. After the Pre-Adverse Action notice is sent, you will have 10 days to dispute the results of your background check. If you would like to dispute your results, please carefully follow the steps below:\nIf you believe the findings of the Checkr report are inaccurate (e.g., the charge(s) listed are not your own, details of the charge are incorrect, out of date, etc.), please contact Checkr via their Checkr Candidate Portal. Through the candidate portal, please follow the dispute process which involves specifying what you believe to be inaccurate on your report and following the appropriate steps. For questions or assistance, please contact Checkr Support.\nIf the findings of the Checkr report are accurate but you would like to provide additional information for consideration regarding the circumstances surrounding the information or charge(s) on your report, or otherwise, please email checkr-review@doordash.com from the email address you used to sign up. If DoorDash does not hear from you within 10 days from when the Pre-Adverse Action Notice was sent to you, DoorDash will make a decision based on the available information.\nAn active Dasher:\n\nIf you received an email with the subject 'Pre-Adverse Action Notice', this means that based on the results of your background check report, you will have 10 days after the Pre-Adverse Action notice is sent to dispute the results of your background check.

To see if a referral bonus is currently available in your area, click on the \u201cPromos\u201d button on the Dash tab or navigate to the Account tab. If there is a live referral bonus, a \"Refer a friend to dash!\" banner will appear at the top of the screen. Clicking into it will show the bonus amount you'd each receive if the person you refer completes the required number of deliveries in the given timeframe. To send a referral link, click the icon on the banner at the bottom, or simply tap on the link to copy the url to your clipboard. \n   How do I know if my friend has successfully been referred?\n\nTo successfully accept your referral, your friend must be a new Dasher (has never created a Dasher account), and must start signing up to be a Dasher using your unique link.\nIf eligible to be referred, your friend will see a blue banner at the top of their signup page and throughout their application process. To start dashing toward the referral bonus, your friend must successfully complete onboarding to become a Dasher. Referral offers are refreshed weekly and are subject to change, so timeliness is encouraged to make sure your offer is locked in.\n\nOnce activated, you and your friend will earn bonuses once they\u2019ve completed the required number of deliveries in their area, within the timeframe specified in their offer. \n  I am unable to refer others currently. When will I be able to refer friends?\n\nDashers in good standing who have completed 30 deliveries and have been dashing for at least 30 days, who have also passed our quality checks will be eligible to refer friends and family to dash. Quality checks are done to ensure a Dasher is in good standing (ie Dasher is not sharing accounts, not engaging in fraud, and has not been flagged for suspicious behavior or incomplete deliveries while Dashing). Referral eligibility is reviewed periodically by our team. Referral bonuses are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. Sometimes, there may not be an active referral offer in your area, but rest assured we will let you know when there\u2019s a new referral opportunity available to you! \n\n   \n\n\n  \nHow can I track the progress of my referrals?\n\nFrom the referrals page, click on the \u201cCheck status\u201d button to view your active referrals. You will be able to see how many deliveries your friends have done toward their referrals and also be able to check in on them to encourage their progress.\n  . \nMy friend sees a different offer than the one I initially referred them under. Why might these be different? \n\nReferral offers are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. The in-progress referrals on the Referrals page reflect offers that are locked in when your friend completes their signup to be a Dasher.  \n\nIn some cases, offers might get refreshed between the time you send a link and when your friend successfully becomes a Dasher.\n\nYour friend may also see a different offer if they are located in a different city and have opted to dash there. You will both receive the bonus tied to the offer they\u2019ve selected.\n\nAll Dasher referrals are governed by terms and conditions that can be found below.\nREFERRAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n\n ",

Why can't I continue to sign up?\nWhat happens if I have a new record since my most recent background check report?\nHow does that process work and how long does it take?\nHow do I dispute the accuracy of my background check or provide more information for DoorDash to consider in its decision?\nMy background check is 'suspended'. What does this mean?\nI received the 'Pre-Adverse Action Notice' email, what can I do?\nI received a'Post-Adverse Action Notice' email, what can I do?\n\nOverview\n\nAs part of our commitment to help protect the DoorDash community, we are constantly evaluating new ways to help promote safety on the platform. Anyone signing up to dash must pass a secure background check before gaining access to the DoorDash platform.\n\nMost Frequently Asked Questions\n\nQ: What is the process?\nA: DoorDash uses accredited third-party background check providers, including Checkr to run secure background checks on all prospective and existing Dashers. Background checks are initiated as part of the signup process, before allowing individuals to access the platform to accept offers as new Dashers. For the continued safety and security of all members of our community, background check reruns are performed under certain circumstances. This allows us to receive and evaluate potential new or updated criminal history records through real-time data sources.\n\nAdditionally, Checkr provides a continuous check feature that can report new offenses occurring after your initial complete background check.\n\nQ: What information is contained in a background check?\nA: Background checks consist of the following:\nMotor Vehicle Report (if using a motor vehicle to dash)\nCriminal History Report\n\nQ: What happens if I have a new record since my most recent background check report?\nA: If your report reflects an incident or information that results in you no longer meeting the background check criteria, your Dasher account will be deactivated from the platform. You will receive an email if this happens.\n\nQ: How does that process work and how long does it take?\nA: If such a record is flagged in your report, you will be notified with a Pre-Adverse Action notice attached to an email sent from no-reply@checkr.com before any deactivation action is taken. That notice will include a copy of your report and additional information, including how you can dispute the accuracy of any information in the background check or provide additional information to be considered. \n\nIf you do not provide any additional information, or dispute the accuracy of your background check with Checkr, within the number of days provided in your Pre-Adverse Action Notice, you will receive a Post-Adverse action notice that provides an explanation of the final decision, and your Dasher account will be deactivated.\n\nQ: How do I dispute the accuracy of my background check or provide more information for DoorDash to consider in its decision?\nA: All of the information needed to dispute the accuracy of background check with Checkr, or to provide additional information to Doordash for consideration, is contained in the Pre-Adverse Action notice attached to the email from no-reply@checkr.com. If you believe the findings of the Checkr report are inaccurate (e.g., the charge(s) listed are not your own, details of the charge are incorrect, out of date, etc.), please contact Checkr via their Checkr Candidate Portal. Through the candidate portal, please follow the dispute process which involves specifying what you believe to be inaccurate on your report and following the appropriate steps. For questions or assistance, please contact Checkr Support.\n\nQ: My background check is 'suspended'. What does that mean?\nA: This usually indicates that you need to provide Checkr with additional information or documentation in order for your background check to continue processing. You should have received an email from no-reply@checkr.com with instructions, or you can log into the Checkr Candidate Portal to view the status of your background check.\n\nQ: Why is my report taking such a long time?\nA: While most background checks are completed within a day, it is not uncommon to encounter longer wait times of one to two weeks due to factors such as DMV and local county office delays. Recall that process includes both a criminal background check and, for those who indicate they will deliver by motorized vehicle, a motor vehicle report check. Individuals who plan to deliver by bicycle do not need to undergo a motor vehicle report check. Please visit the Checkr Candidate Portal for the most up-to-date estimates.\n\nBecause the checks are performed by Checkr, not DoorDash, DoorDash is unable to expedite or provide estimated completion times. Contact Checkr Support if you have any further questions about processing times.\n\nQ: Checkr says my report is complete. Why can't I continue to sign up?\nA: Complete is a term that Checkr uses to indicate it has finished compiling the information on a report. A report being \u201cComplete\u201d is not an indication that the results of the search have been reviewed or of an individual\u2019s eligibility to access the DoorDash platform. In other words, not all \u201cComplete\u201d reports have been reviewed and received a \u201cClear\u201d status that would allow you to move on to the next step in the sign-up process. To check whether your completed report is \u201cClear\u201d or requires any additional action, please log in to the Checkr Candidate Portal.\n\nIf you opted to receive a copy of your background check or live in a state that requires a copy to be sent, you should have received an email from Checkr with the subject line \u201cYour DoorDash background check is complete!\u201d.\n\nQ: What does my background check status mean?\nA: The answer depends on which message you see when you sign in to your Dasher signup account. The following messages are what you should be looking for:\nClear\nClear: Your background check is clear and you are ready to move on to the next step in the sign-up process. You should have received an email from no-reply@checkr.com with the following message: \n\n\"Congratulations! This message means you have completed and cleared the background check step. Finish the next steps in the app to start dashing.\"\n\nPlease note: In certain locations, there may be a waitlist to start dashing right away, and you will need to wait for a welcome email from DoorDash\n\nIn Progress\nConsider: Your background check has been processed by Checkr and has been shared with us for internal review. Click here to view your current status. \n\nThe Consider status means that Checkr has processed your background check, but the results require additional review. \n\nReviews are typically completed within 5 business days. To see the results of your review and if you are eligible to Dash, please search your email inbox (the address associated with your Dasher signup) for an email with the subject \u2018Pre-Adverse Action Notice\u2019 or \u2018Post-Adverse Action Notice\u2019. \n\nPending: Your background check is still being processed by Checkr. Click here to view your current status with Checkr and whether they need additional information from you in order to complete your background check.\n\nSometimes Checkr may require additional information in order to complete the process. Please provide any additional information requested by Checkr by logging in to the Checkr Candidate Portal.\n\nIf Checkr has not requested any additional information  or if you have already submitted the requested information, this means your background check is still being processed by Checkr. DoorDash is unable to expedite or provide estimates on wait times, because the reports are compiled and completed by Checkr, not DoorDash. Please visit the Checkr Candidate Portal for the most up-to-date estimated completion time. For additional information regarding estimated completion times, please contact Checkr Support.\n\nDisputed: Your background check dispute is being reviewed by Checkr. Disputed background checks can take up to 30 days.\n\nIf you have disputed the results of a report with Checkr, then you may see this status. It means that Checkr has received your dispute and is reviewing it. Checkr requires up to 30 days to process disputes.\n\nQ: How can I check the status of my background check?\nA: The background check process varies, but it can take 5-7 business days and, in some instances, a bit longer. If you have questions about the status of your background check, you can reach out to Checkr for more information by:\nClicking on the link below and providing the phone number, email, social security number, and date of birth you used for your background check. Once you have provided the information, click the Get Status button.\nCheckr Candidate Portal\n\nQ: I received the 'Pre-Adverse Action Notice' email, what can I do?\nA: If you are:\n\nSigning up to become a Dasher:\n\nIf you received an email with the subject 'Pre-Adverse Action Notice', this means that based on the information in your background check report, you may be precluded from proceeding with the sign up process. After the Pre-Adverse Action notice is sent, you will have 10 days to dispute the results of your background check. If you would like to dispute your results, please carefully follow the steps below:\nIf you believe the findings of the Checkr report are inaccurate (e.g., the charge(s) listed are not your own, details of the charge are incorrect, out of date, etc.), please contact Checkr via their Checkr Candidate Portal. Through the candidate portal, please follow the dispute process which involves specifying what you believe to be inaccurate on your report and following the appropriate steps. For questions or assistance, please contact Checkr Support.\nIf the findings of the Checkr report are accurate but you would like to provide additional information for consideration regarding the circumstances surrounding the information or charge(s) on your report, or otherwise, please email checkr-review@doordash.com from the email address you used to sign up. If DoorDash does not hear from you within 10 days from when the Pre-Adverse Action Notice was sent to you, DoorDash will make a decision based on the available information.\nAn active Dasher:\n\nIf you received an email with the subject 'Pre-Adverse Action Notice', this means that based on the results of your background check report, you will have 10 days after the Pre-Adverse Action notice is sent to dispute the results of your background check. In the meantime, your Dasher account will be unavailable. If you would like to dispute or appeal the initial results, please carefully read the following:\nIf you believe the findings of the Checkr report are inaccurate (e.g., the charge(s) listed are not your own, details of the charge are incorrect, out of date, etc.), please contact Checkr via their Checkr Candidate Portal.

However, you still have the ability to do the following:\nIf you believe the findings of the Checkr report are inaccurate (e.g., the charge(s) listed are not your own, details of the charge are incorrect, out of date, etc.), please contact Checkr via their Checkr Candidate Portal.

To see if a referral bonus is currently available in your area, click on the \u201cPromos\u201d button on the Dash tab or navigate to the Account tab. If there is a live referral bonus, a \"Refer a friend to dash!\" banner will appear at the top of the screen. Clicking into it will show the bonus amount you'd each receive if the person you refer completes the required number of deliveries in the given timeframe. To send a referral link, click the icon on the banner at the bottom, or simply tap on the link to copy the url to your clipboard. \n   How do I know if my friend has successfully been referred?\n\nTo successfully accept your referral, your friend must be a new Dasher (has never created a Dasher account), and must start signing up to be a Dasher using your unique link.\nIf eligible to be referred, your friend will see a blue banner at the top of their signup page and throughout their application process. To start dashing toward the referral bonus, your friend must successfully complete onboarding to become a Dasher. Referral offers are refreshed weekly and are subject to change, so timeliness is encouraged to make sure your offer is locked in.\n\nOnce activated, you and your friend will earn bonuses once they\u2019ve completed the required number of deliveries in their area, within the timeframe specified in their offer. \n  I am unable to refer others currently. When will I be able to refer friends?\n\nDashers in good standing who have completed 30 deliveries and have been dashing for at least 30 days, who have also passed our quality checks will be eligible to refer friends and family to dash. Quality checks are done to ensure a Dasher is in good standing (ie Dasher is not sharing accounts, not engaging in fraud, and has not been flagged for suspicious behavior or incomplete deliveries while Dashing). Referral eligibility is reviewed periodically by our team. Referral bonuses are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. Sometimes, there may not be an active referral offer in your area, but rest assured we will let you know when there\u2019s a new referral opportunity available to you! \n\n   \n\n\n  \nHow can I track the progress of my referrals?\n\nFrom the referrals page, click on the \u201cCheck status\u201d button to view your active referrals. You will be able to see how many deliveries your friends have done toward their referrals and also be able to check in on them to encourage their progress.\n  . \nMy friend sees a different offer than the one I initially referred them under. Why might these be different? \n\nReferral offers are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. The in-progress referrals on the Referrals page reflect offers that are locked in when your friend completes their signup to be a Dasher.  \n\nIn some cases, offers might get refreshed between the time you send a link and when your friend successfully becomes a Dasher.\n\nYour friend may also see a different offer if they are located in a different city and have opted to dash there. You will both receive the bonus tied to the offer they\u2019ve selected.\n\nAll Dasher referrals are governed by terms and conditions that can be found below.\nREFERRAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n\n ",

You will need your 2 pieces of ID. If you are doing it on your computer, you can join a live video chat with a Checkr agent (during Checkrs regular operating hours). If you are doing it on your phone, you will need to record a short video where you hold your two pieces of ID up by your face and state your full name. Once you finish the video, you can upload it to the Checkr portal and it will take 3-5 minutes for an agent to verify your video.\n\nQ: Does DoorDash keep any of this information from the background check?\nA: No - DoorDash does not keep any information from the background check. All information resides with Checkr and is not shared with us.\n\nQ: How can I check the status of my background check?\nA: Background checks are processed through our third-party consumer reporting agency, Checkr.

The Dashers with the highest earnings are typically those who actively accept and complete a high number of delivery requests.\n\nGetting more offers\n\nTiming is Everything\nThe most active times for orders tend to be around lunch and dinner. Log on and be ready to accept offers during these peak hours when demand from customers is at its highest.\nTake Advantage of Peak Pay\nKeep an eye on Peak Pay campaigns within the Dasher app, where you can earn extra money on top of the standard pay for each delivery. These campaigns are usually available during the busiest times and in busy areas.\nRed Card (U.S only) and Proximity\nHaving your Red Card on hand allows you to receive a wider range of orders. Additionally, staying as close to the merchants as possible not only can get you orders faster but also maximize your efficiency.\nEquipment and Dash Preferences\nMake sure that your account preferences are set to maximize your delivery opportunities. Certain orders may also require you to have a specific type of vehicle. It\u2019s a good idea to periodically review your settings to ensure they align with your current availability and capabilities.\nHotspots Are Your Friend\nWatch for areas marked with a red flame icon, known as hotspots. These are prime locations for accepting offers due to their proximity to restaurants with frequent orders. Positioning yourself near these hotspots can increase the likelihood of receiving more delivery requests.\nSeek Out High-Demand Areas\nYour Dasher app is designed to help you identify the busiest areas with a color-coded map \u2013 red zones often represent areas with a higher number of available orders.\nExpert Advice\nHere is advice from a very experienced Dasher in California named Tamara. She has done 1400+ deliveries, and she has some great advice for accepting the most offers and earning the most money while dashing!\nDasher Advice from Tamara - Maximizing Earnings from DoorDash on Youtube.\n\nPlease note that market conditions vary and the experiences of Dashers can differ based on a number of factors.

You\u2019ll know that it\u2019s a large order when you see \u2018Catering Bag Required\u2019 on the acceptance screen. This is part of a broader effort to improve the assignment process for high-value deliveries.\nYou\u2019ll still have priority access to these high-value orders \u2014 just for being a valuable part of our Large Order program.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions: \n  Q: Why can I no longer claim deliveries the prior day?\nA: Starting June 2, Drive deliveries will only be offered as you\u2019re out on your regular dash and can no longer be pre-claimed.\nQ: I\u2019ve not seen any orders available to claim in the scheduled tab for the past X weeks. Was I removed from the program?\nA: Nope, you\u2019ve not been removed from the program. You\u2019re still eligible to receive Drive catering deliveries, they\u2019ll just be offered in real-time. You may have seen an icon that looks like this in the accept modal as you\u2019re dashing:\n  Q: Do I still have priority access to catering deliveries?\nA: Yes, you\u2019ll still receive priority access to catering delivery opportunities \u2014 just for being a valuable part of our Large Order program.

Be on the lookout for this icon in the accept modal to flag these larger delivery offers. \n \nQ: Why are you making this change?\nA: Over the past couple of months, we received numerous reports from Dashers that our pre-claimed system is not functioning as intended. In order to improve your overall dashing experience, we will be moving Drive deliveries to a more effective assignment algorithm.\n\nQ: Why am I not able to view my Drive ratings page? \nA: The separate Drive ratings page has been removed as part of a broader effort to improve the assignment process. Ratings for Large Order deliveries will now be included together with your overall delivery rating. Starting June 2nd, you will start to notice that more of these Drive deliveries are being offered in real-time as you dash. You will continue to get priority access to these Large Order deliveries over regular dashers\nQ: Will you still use my ratings to determine which window I can pre-claim Drive deliveries?\nA: No, Dashers will no longer be able to pre-claim deliveries as they will all be offered real-time.\nQ: I would like to know more about the Large Order Program\nA: To learn more about the Drive LOF Program, please visit our Dasher Help Center article by clicking here.\n ",

While the app is pretty good about tracking where the dasher is, there are times when customers get impatient. On a normal order, I text when I have the order and what my ETA is.  I am sure to communicate with customers anytime the merchant is taking longer than expected, are out of a requested item, when I have multiple orders to drop off, basically anytime something comes up that may affect the customer, let them know. - Randy, Dasher, Castle Rock CO, 4000+ deliveries\n  Send a courtesy text when at the restaurant and let the customer know if there is any wait or if any item is unavailable. Communication plays a major factor and can ultimately lead to a larger tip and better ratings. -  Jonathan, Dasher, Fort Drum NY,  2000+ deliveries\n  When you arrive at the restaurant, send a courtesy text to let the customer know you have received their order pick up request and advise them of any expected wait times or possible delays... Communication is the major tool. Ratings and tips will be impacted by more communication with the customers such as \u201c I\u2019m on the way\u201d or \u201c my GPS says I should be there in 14 minutes.\u201d - Brian, Dasher, Vancouver BC, 2000+ deliveries\n  Use a communication method that works for the customer. If you send a text message and get no response, call the customer. Not everyone embraces text messaging as much as we do... I use templates because that way I don\u2019t have to worry about autocorrects before I send it. It\u2019s easier and quicker when I copy and paste. - Kari, Dasher, Killeen TX, 2000+ deliveries\n  \n\nFor inspiration, below are examples of text templates that actual Top Dashers use during deliveries that you could adapt for your own use.\n  During pickup:\nThere\u2019s a little wait time at the restaurant on orders, as soon as I get your order I will text you with a live ETA.\nHello, this is your Dasher. Your order is taking a bit longer to prepare than expected. I apologize for any inconvenience. \nHi this is [name] your Dasher. I'm here at the restaurant but the food is taking a little longer than expected. I'll be there as soon as possible. \n  After pickup:\nHey this is, (your name here)! I just picked up your order and I'm (this many minutes) mins away \ud83e\udd17\n  After drop off:\nHi, I left your order at the door. Have a day/great night! Thank you \ud83d\ude01\nThis is [name], your Dasher. I left your order at the door! Thank you for ordering  and have a great day. Enjoy!\nBatched orders:\nHey this is your Dasher, I\u2019m waiting on your order at the moment. I would like to also let you know I do have a drop off before yours. See you soon!\n\nCustomers report that they appreciate it when their Dashers keep them informed during the delivery, which can lead to better tips and ratings.\n  Thanks for the updates. Can't believe how crazy it is in there\u2026 You'll definitely be getting an extra tip for your patience. - Corryn, Customer\n\nExperience was actually awesome. The Dasher was amazing, he was so amazing - he was patient. He updated me at every twist and turn. He communicated with me every step of the way\u2026 He was so understanding and patient. - Cherry, Customer",
