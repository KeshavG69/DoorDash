# üöÄ Dasher Support Automation with Large Language Models  

This repository contains a project that automates support for Dashers using **large language models (LLMs)**. The solution draws inspiration from DoorDash's innovative [Dasher support automation](https://careersatdoordash.com/blog/large-language-modules-based-dasher-support-automation/) system and replicates many of its key ideas to demonstrate the power of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems for customer support.

## üåü **Features**  
1. **Web Scraping with Selenium**: Extracted articles from the [Dasher Help Center](https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/?language=en_US) and saved them in CSV format.  
2. **RAG System**:  
   - Summarized and embedded articles for vector database indexing.  
   - Retrieved and re-ranked relevant articles to answer user queries.  
   - Integrated retrieved articles with LLMs to generate responses.  
3. **Response Guardrails**:  
   - **Layer 1**: Checked semantic similarity between generated response and retrieved content.  
   - **Layer 2**: Evaluated responses for groundedness, coherence, compliance, and query relevance using a larger LLM.  
4. **Streamlit Web App**: User-friendly interface for interacting with the project.  
5. **Command-Line Execution**: A single terminal command runs the entire pipeline.

## üîß **Setup and Installation**  
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dasher-support-automation.git
   cd dasher-support-automation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:  
   Add your API keys for Tohether, Groq, and Cohere in an `.env` file:  
   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
   TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_key
   COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_key
   ```

4. **Run the Web Scraping Notebook**:  
   Extract articles from the Dasher Help Center using the notebook `DoorDashCustomerCareRAG_WebScrape.ipynb`.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Run**  
### Streamlit Web App  
Run the Streamlit app to interact with the solution through a web interface:  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Command-Line Execution  
Run the entire project pipeline directly from the terminal:  
```bash
python main.py
```

## üöÄ **How It Works**  

### Web Scraping  
- Used Selenium to scrape articles from the Dasher Help Center.  
- Addressed challenges like dynamic loading by handling the "Load More" button and waiting for content to load.

### RAG System  
- Summarized articles using an LLM and embedded summaries for vector search using Pinecone.  
- Retrieved top articles based on query relevance.  
- Re-ranked retrieved articles using Cohere to ensure the top 3 results were the most accurate.  

### Response Generation  
- Constructed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline.  
- Combined retrieved articles and user queries to generate precise and contextually relevant responses.

### Response Guardrails  
1. **Layer 1: Semantic Similarity Check**  
   Ensured a semantic similarity score of >70% between the retrieved articles and the generated response using cosine similarity.  

2. **Layer 2: LLM-Based Evaluation**  
   Used a larger LLM to verify that responses:  
   - Are **grounded** in retrieved content.  
   - Are **coherent** and logically structured.  
   - Are **compliant** with guidelines.  
   - **Answer the user‚Äôs query** effectively.  

   Failed responses escalated to a human agent.
