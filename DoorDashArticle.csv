What is a Dasher Red Card?
The Red Card is a prepaid card that Dashers use to pay for items on Dasher Shop & Deliver offers. The card will automatically be funded when you go to check out for a shopping offer. Red Cards are not linked to Dasher bank accounts or related to earnings.
Red Cards can be:
Digital - stored in the digital wallet in your phone (recommended)
Physical - physical card ordered from the DoorDash store

Why do I need a Red Card?
DoorDash Shop & Deliver offers can only be completed with a Red Card. We suggest to make sure to bring a Red Card with you so that you can accept these offers and take advantage of every earning opportunity. Most merchants accept contactless payments so you will likely be able to check out with a digital card. If you are checking out at a merchant that does not accept contactless payments, you can use your physical Red Card if you have one. If you do not have a physical Red Card, you have the option to use your personal card, keep the receipt, and reach out to support for reimbursement.

Q: What are the phone requirements to dash?
A: Dashers can use their iOS or Android phones. Certain jailbroken or rooted phones may have trouble accessing the Dasher app. If you are having trouble accessing the Dasher App after multiple attempts, you can try to reset your phone or login using another phone altogether.

Dashing with a newer phone that has more memory can help reduce issues with crashes and restarts. On average, newer phones with >3GB RAM crash and freeze less than others. Consider upgrading your device to help improve your experience while dashing.

Q: Can someone else drive for me and/or help me drop off deliveries?
A: As an independent contractor, you are free to choose the method by which you perform the delivery. It is entirely up to you to complete the delivery service yourself or to delegate the tasks to your employee or subcontractor. Someone else may drive for you or help you drop off deliveries, however they must have a valid Dasher account as well. For more information, please refer to the Independent Contractor Agreement here (link Section 8 of the ICA (Personnel)).

Q: Does DoorDash have insurance? 
A: Yes, DoorDash has a commercial auto insurance policy that covers up to $1,000,000 in bodily injury and/or property damage to third parties arising out of accidents while on an active delivery. More information is available here.

Q: What if I get injured while making a delivery?
A: For U.S. Dashers: If you suffer an injury while making a delivery with DoorDash, you may be eligible for occupational accident coverage. Occupational accident insurance offers several important benefits due to covered accidents for Dashers including medical expenses, disability payments, and survivors benefits. For more information, visit Occupational Accident Policy FAQ.

Q: Do I need my own insurance?
A: Yes, while doing business as an independent contractor, you are required to maintain your own insurance, in the amounts and of types required by law which includes, but is not limited to, an auto insurance policy. If you fail to maintain your own insurance, DoorDash's coverage may not apply.

Overview

As part of our commitment to help protect the DoorDash community, we are constantly evaluating new ways to help promote safety on the platform. Anyone signing up to dash must pass a secure background check before gaining access to the DoorDash platform.

Most Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What is the process?
A: DoorDash uses accredited third-party background check providers, including Checkr to run secure background checks on all prospective and existing Dashers. Background checks are initiated as part of the signup process, before allowing individuals to access the platform to accept offers as new Dashers. For the continued safety and security of all members of our community, background check reruns are performed under certain circumstances. This allows us to receive and evaluate potential new or updated criminal history records through real-time data sources.

Additionally, Checkr provides a continuous check feature that can report new offenses occurring after your initial complete background check.

Q: What information is contained in a background check?
A: Background checks consist of the following:
Motor Vehicle Report (if using a motor vehicle to dash)
Criminal History Report

Q: What happens if I have a new record since my most recent background check report?
A: If your report reflects an incident or information that results in you no longer meeting the background check criteria, your Dasher account will be deactivated from the platform. You will receive an email if this happens.

Q: How does that process work and how long does it take?
A: If such a record is flagged in your report, you will be notified with a Pre-Adverse Action notice attached to an email sent from no-reply@checkr.com before any deactivation action is taken. That notice will include a copy of your report and additional information, including how you can dispute the accuracy of any information in the background check or provide additional information to be considered. 

If you do not provide any additional information, or dispute the accuracy of your background check with Checkr, within the number of days provided in your Pre-Adverse Action Notice, you will receive a Post-Adverse action notice that provides an explanation of the final decision, and your Dasher account will be deactivated.

Q: How do I dispute the accuracy of my background check or provide more information for DoorDash to consider in its decision?
A: All of the information needed to dispute the accuracy of background check with Checkr, or to provide additional information to Doordash for consideration, is contained in the Pre-Adverse Action notice attached to the email from no-reply@checkr.com. If you believe the findings of the Checkr report are inaccurate (e.g., the charge(s) listed are not your own, details of the charge are incorrect, out of date, etc.), please contact Checkr via their Checkr Candidate Portal. Through the candidate portal, please follow the dispute process which involves specifying what you believe to be inaccurate on your report and following the appropriate steps. For questions or assistance, please contact Checkr Support.

Q: My background check is 'suspended'. What does that mean?
A: This usually indicates that you need to provide Checkr with additional information or documentation in order for your background check to continue processing. You should have received an email from no-reply@checkr.com with instructions, or you can log into the Checkr Candidate Portal to view the status of your background check.

Q: Why is my report taking such a long time?
A: While most background checks are completed within a day, it is not uncommon to encounter longer wait times of one to two weeks due to factors such as DMV and local county office delays. Recall that process includes both a criminal background check and, for those who indicate they will deliver by motorized vehicle, a motor vehicle report check. Individuals who plan to deliver by bicycle do not need to undergo a motor vehicle report check. Please visit the Checkr Candidate Portal for the most up-to-date estimates.

Because the checks are performed by Checkr, not DoorDash, DoorDash is unable to expedite or provide estimated completion times. Contact Checkr Support if you have any further questions about processing times.

Q: Checkr says my report is complete. Why can't I continue to sign up?
A: Complete is a term that Checkr uses to indicate it has finished compiling the information on a report. A report being “Complete” is not an indication that the results of the search have been reviewed or of an individual’s eligibility to access the DoorDash platform. In other words, not all “Complete” reports have been reviewed and received a “Clear” status that would allow you to move on to the next step in the sign-up process. To check whether your completed report is “Clear” or requires any additional action, please log in to the Checkr Candidate Portal.

If you opted to receive a copy of your background check or live in a state that requires a copy to be sent, you should have received an email from Checkr with the subject line “Your DoorDash background check is complete!”.

Q: What does my background check status mean?
A: The answer depends on which message you see when you sign in to your Dasher signup account. The following messages are what you should be looking for:
Clear
Clear: Your background check is clear and you are ready to move on to the next step in the sign-up process. You should have received an email from no-reply@checkr.com with the following message: 

""Congratulations! This message means you have completed and cleared the background check step. Finish the next steps in the app to start dashing.""

Please note: In certain locations, there may be a waitlist to start dashing right away, and you will need to wait for a welcome email from DoorDash

In Progress
Consider: Your background check has been processed by Checkr and has been shared with us for internal review. Click here to view your current status. 

The Consider status means that Checkr has processed your background check, but the results require additional review. 

Reviews are typically completed within 5 business days. To see the results of your review and if you are eligible to Dash, please search your email inbox (the address associated with your Dasher signup) for an email with the subject ‘Pre-Adverse Action Notice’ or ‘Post-Adverse Action Notice’. 

Pending: Your background check is still being processed by Checkr. Click here to view your current status with Checkr and whether they need additional information from you in order to complete your background check.

Sometimes Checkr may require additional information in order to complete the process. Please provide any additional information requested by Checkr by logging in to the Checkr Candidate Portal.

If Checkr has not requested any additional information  or if you have already submitted the requested information, this means your background check is still being processed by Checkr. DoorDash is unable to expedite or provide estimates on wait times, because the reports are compiled and completed by Checkr, not DoorDash. Please visit the Checkr Candidate Portal for the most up-to-date estimated completion time. For additional information regarding estimated completion times, please contact Checkr Support.

Disputed: Your background check dispute is being reviewed by Checkr. Disputed background checks can take up to 30 days.

If you have disputed the results of a report with Checkr, then you may see this status. It means that Checkr has received your dispute and is reviewing it. Checkr requires up to 30 days to process disputes.

Q: How can I check the status of my background check?
A: The background check process varies, but it can take 5-7 business days and, in some instances, a bit longer. If you have questions about the status of your background check, you can reach out to Checkr for more information by:
Clicking on the link below and providing the phone number, email, social security number, and date of birth you used for your background check. Once you have provided the information, click the Get Status button.

Resolving Issues
  Pick Up / Drop Off
You can earn more tips by offering superior pick-up and drop-off service! Check out the following pro tips to earn more.
Arrive on-time. Arrive to the store at or slightly before the quoted pickup time. Contact the customer upon arrival, but no more than ten minutes early. If it seems like you are going to be arriving late to the store, contact the store or DoorDash support.
Verify you are picking up the correct order. Share the order ID and confirm the customer’s name with the store to confirm you are picking up the right items. Also, review the receipt to ensure you are picking up the correct order
Confirm you have each item in the order. After swiping to indicate your arrival at the restaurant, your Dasher app will display all the items in the order. Double-check the order contents to ensure items are not missing and all special instructions have been followed. Feel free to ask the merchant to help you do a final item check.
If you are missing an item or have a different item than the order states, ask the merchant if the item is unavailable or substituted. If the merchant confirms unavailable or substituted, report this using the three dots next to the item in the Dasher app pickup screen. This will inform the customer and provide a refund to the customer if the item is unavailable.
Grab some freebies. Grab freebies like utensils, napkins, sauces or other requests indicated by the consumer.
Communicate with your customer. Create texts you can reuse to give proactive updates as you go.
Follow delivery instructions. Follow the customer’s delivery instructions (if applicable) to deliver the order promptly. Please also confirm again at drop-off that the name and/or order ID match the information provided within the app. 
  Food Safety
Food safety is extremely important. Maintain the integrity of the order with the following tips in mind.
Deliver with care. Bring at least one clean hot bag keeps food safe, fresh, and secure. Carefully pack and load the order by placing heavier items on the bottom of the bag and smaller items on top and laying boxes / platters flat. Take your time securing items in your vehicle before heading to the customer.
Separate hot and cold items. Avoid food spoilage by separating hot and cold items
Do not tamper with the food. Keep in mind, you cannot tamper with the food as you double check the order.

Batched Orders
Batched orders are multiple orders along the same route which gives you the opportunity to make more money, faster. Tap “Add Order to Route” to accept. 
Follow the color coded steps. On the “Current Dash” screen, follow the steps from top to bottom. Steps will be color coded by order so you know which order each step is referring to.
Label each order. Use post-it notes and a pen to label each order with the corresponding customer’s name. This will eliminate confusion when dropping off batched orders.
  Alcohol Orders
While on a dash, Dashers in the US who are over 21 years old and have a valid driver’s license may see orders containing alcohol beverages. When handling alcohol, it’s important to keep the law in mind and deliver alcohol compliantly.
Please review DoorDash’s Delivering Alcohol Guidelines to ensure you know how to deliver orders containing alcohol. Remember, you could be held liable if you deliver alcohol to a minor or someone who is visibly intoxicated, so it’s important that you know what to do to protect yourself and the customer.
Important reminders:
You must verify the customer’s identity before you hand them an order containing alcohol. You cannot leave an alcohol order unattended or hand it to someone else.
Dashers cannot consume alcohol prior to or while dashing—or be under the influence of anything.
This is serious business. You may be held liable if you provide alcohol to an underage person or a person who is intoxicated.
Remember, we’re here to support you! If you have any questions before, during, or after a dash, get in touch with us through the Dasher app.

DoorDash Drive
DoorDash Drive orders are large deliveries that require special handling and are reserved for qualifying Dashers. For detailed instructions, please review the Drive Dasher Help Page.
Offer great service. Dress to impress and bring at least one large, insulated catering bag, as merchants may refuse Dashers that arrive without proper equipment and/or are not dressed in appropriate attire (closed-toed shoes).
Follow special setup instructions. If the setup is required, merchant-provided setup instructions and example photo(s) will be provided. You will not be asked to open food or light sternos. Once you complete all merchant instructions listed, take a confirmation photo of the setup. The photos are shared directly with merchants for review. See Completing a Drive Large Order Delivery for more information.
  Resolving Issues
When in doubt, Contact Dasher Support. Tap the “HELP” or “?” icons in your Dasher app to get support while you dash.
Complete your first Dash. Your Dash is the most important one because it verifies everything in your Dasher app is working properly. If you have problems during your First Dash, contact live support to fix any bugs--or go to a DoorDash office for in-person help.
Communicate first, resolve second. Communicate with the customer or restaurant first, then resolve your issue via Dasher Help.

Canada Background Check FAQ,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Canada-Background-Check-FAQ,"Canada Background Check 

For Canada Dashers only

Overview
DoorDash always runs a secure background check on all applicants before clearing new Dashers to access the platform. As part of our commitment to help protect the DoorDash community, we are constantly evaluating new ways to help promote safety on the platform.

Frequently Asked Questions
Q: What license do I need to become a Dasher?
A: We only accept full license classes in Canada. 

Q: I did not finish my background check and now I can't figure out how to get back. What should I do?
A: Look for an email from canadasupport@checkr.com with the subject line ""DoorDash Has Requested Your Consent For Screening"" and click on the Continue button in the email to get back to your background check profile. 

Q: What if I can't find my Checkr link?
A: Please go to doordash.com/help for assistance. You can get in touch with a support agent by selecting the phone or chat option.

Q: The Continue link is asking me for a password. I haven’t created a password yet!
A: Re-open the email, and try the DoorDash account email and password. If that does not work, please click on Reset Password and input a new password.

Q: I’m not sure what to fill in for Surname at birth, former name and date of entry?
A: Please fill in all applicable fields - however, not all fields are required, and those that are required are marked with *. If you do miss a required field, an orange box will appear at the bottom of the page to highlight which field you are missing.

Q: I’ve moved recently from another country, and one of my addresses in the past 5 years did not have postal codes, nor provinces. What should I put in?
A: Please put in the address as close as possible. For postal code and province, you may put 000 000 and N/A if they do not apply to your previous residence. If you are inputting a postal code, please make sure you put in the proper format: (i.e. N6K 4F9).

Q: What is the identity verification question - is this supposed to trick me?
A: Not at all! These questions are there for your safety and are designed to verify your identity. Please carefully read each question and answer them correctly to complete the process.

Q: What happens if I get the identity verification questions wrong?
A: If you answer your identity verification questions incorrectly, don’t panic - you can still complete the sign up process! You will receive a prompt from Checkr on how to do video verification.

Q: What is Video Verification?
A: If you answer your identity verification questions incorrectly, you will be prompted to complete video verification. You will need your 2 pieces of ID. If you are doing it on your computer, you can join a live video chat with a Checkr agent (during Checkrs regular operating hours). If you are doing it on your phone, you will need to record a short video where you hold your two pieces of ID up by your face and state your full name.

Item has run out/is unavailable,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Item-has-run-out-is-unavailable,"Item has run out/is unavailable

If an item has run out or is unavailable, you can easily report this within the pickup screen in your Dasher app by following the next steps:
Click on the 3 dots next to the item name on the pickup screen within the Dasher app.
Here you can choose one of two options:
The item is unavailable with no substitution
The item is unavailable and will be substituted with a different item.
A notification will be automatically sent to the customer and if there is no substitution, the customer will receive a refund. Additionally, the merchant’s menu is updated to show that the item is currently unavailable so no other customers will have this experience.

Another course of action you can take is to contact the customer directly. You should ask if there is an item of the same value that they would like to replace the unavailable item with and then communicate that to the merchant to be prepared.

However, if the customer prefers to substitute with an item of a different value or just wants the price of the unavailable item refunded, then let the customer know they can reach out to DoorDash Support to modify the order. The customer can start a chat with an agent by going to the order tracker page in the mobile app or website, selecting Help in the upper right-hand corner of the tracker, and pressing Make adjustments to this order.

If a customer or restaurant asks you to modify the order in any way (add or remove items, deliver later, etc.), please request that they contact DoorDash Support and do not make any changes to the order on their behalf. Otherwise, we will not be able to track the appropriate charges. Once they contact Support to modify, you will see the order update in-app.

What is a Dasher Red Card?
The Red Card is a prepaid card that Dashers use to pay for items on Dasher Shop & Deliver offers. The card will automatically be funded when you go to check out for a shopping offer. Red Cards are not linked to Dasher bank accounts or related to earnings.
Red Cards can be:
Digital - stored in the digital wallet in your phone (recommended)
Physical - physical card ordered from the DoorDash store

Why do I need a Red Card?
DoorDash Shop & Deliver offers can only be completed with a Red Card. We suggest to make sure to bring a Red Card with you so that you can accept these offers and take advantage of every earning opportunity. Most merchants accept contactless payments so you will likely be able to check out with a digital card. If you are checking out at a merchant that does not accept contactless payments, you can use your physical Red Card if you have one. If you do not have a physical Red Card, you have the option to use your personal card, keep the receipt, and reach out to support for reimbursement.

Why did I receive multiple offers at once?,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Why-did-I-receive-multiple-orders-at-once,"Why did I receive multiple offers at once?
While dashing, getting more offers means more opportunities to earn! Sometimes, you may even get multiple offers at the same time or sequentially. These are called “batched offers”.

What are the advantages of batched offers?
Batched offers allow Dashers to quickly complete two or more orders in less time than usual. Often, batched offers will be picked up at the same restaurant, which increases a Dasher's earnings and efficiency. These batches may happen from time to time, especially during peak hours.
How can I accept and complete batched offers?
You can accept a batched offers one of two ways:
Accepting an offer that shows 2 or more orders on the offer screen
Accepting an additional offer while on your way to pick up the first order, by clicking the ""Add to Route"" button
To simplify completing batched offers, the Dasher app will suggest an order of operations for the batch, but as always, you are free to use your best judgment when choosing how to deliver each order. To see all of the orders during a batched offer (and switch between them if you wish), tap the menu at the top of the Dasher app.

Note that when Peak Pay is in effect, it may be paid per single or batched delivery."
My delivery was picked up by someone else,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/My-order-was-picked-up-by-someone-else,"What can I do if a restaurant says the delivery I accepted was picked up by someone else?

If a restaurant says your delivery was picked up by another Dasher, you may choose to double-check before contacting support. If you remind the restaurant that many customers have similar names, show the restaurant the order on your phone, and read some of the items to them, restaurants may realize that they are thinking of a different DoorDash order.

However, if the restaurant still believes the delivery was already picked up--or if you choose not to double-check--you can contact support immediately through the Dasher app. Support will contact the restaurant to remake the order so you can complete the delivery as usual.

You may also use the Self Help option in your Dasher app for 'Order not is not here' instructions.

Delivering Tobacco Guidelines,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Delivering-Tobacco-Guidelines,"Delivering Tobacco Guidelines
DoorDash does not currently allow Merchants to directly sell tobacco products, electronic cigarettes, or other similar products on our consumer-facing Marketplace platform.
However, in some states, provinces, and territories where it is legal, Merchants with a tobacco-specific agreement with DoorDash may request Dasher delivery of tobacco products that customers have purchased directly from the Merchant through the Merchant’s own channels or through other platforms.  
The following information is intended to help you responsibly and lawfully deliver tobacco products in those circumstances.  Please note that you could be held liable if you deliver tobacco products to a minor, so it's important that you follow this process fully to protect yourself, the customer, and the health and safety of minors.  As a reminder, you are free to decline any delivery offer, including tobacco deliveries.
I. TOBACCO PRODUCT PICK-UP
Tobacco orders are age-restricted in accordance with local law.  In order to pick up a tobacco order, you will be required to present your valid driver's license or another valid government-issued ID, so please make sure you have your ID on you before accepting the order.

II. TOBACCO PRODUCT DROP-OFF
A. AGE AND ID VERIFICATION
You can only deliver tobacco products to a customer if the customer meets the minimum age requirement under local law:
21+ in the U.S.
18+ in Australia; or 
18, 19, or 21+ in Canada in accordance with provincial law.
To verify age, ask the customer to see a valid ID.  Check every customer’s ID every time, even if the customer clearly appears to be over the legally-required age.  A valid ID must include a photograph and date of birth.  For example, acceptable forms of ID may include:
A valid driver's license or identification card issued by federal, state, provincial, county, or municipal government.
A valid passport.
An identification card issued by the Armed Forces of the United States that contains the name, date of birth, description, and picture of the person.
Next, make sure the ID is not invalid or fake:
Check the expiration date. Do not accept an ID that is expired.
Ask to remove the ID from the wallet.
Compare the customer at the door to the photo in the ID.  Examine facial features: are the height, eye shape, ear and nose shape or placement similar?  Ignore weight, hair and makeup as these may change.
Feel the edges of the ID - a legitimate ID will have smooth, uniform edges.  A fake ID may have rougher edges and perhaps may be coming apart.
Look for glue lines or bumpy or uneven surfaces. A real ID’s surface should be consistent.
If the customer’s ID check fails your physical examination or an app-prompted ID scan, do not complete the delivery; instead, return the tobacco product(s) to the merchant.

B. RESTRICTED LOCATIONS
Do NOT, under any circumstances, deliver tobacco products to the following locations:
Public or private school (K-12) (e.g. an elementary school);
Hospitals & health care facilities;
Sports venues or any place hosting a sporting event;
College campus (e.g. a fraternity house, residence hall, library);
Prison, reformatory, veterans’ home, or state capitol grounds;
P.O. Boxes;
Locker or similar package storage service (e.g. a storage facility); or
Other business that sells tobacco products (e.g. tobacco retail shop).
C.  JUDGMENT
Lastly, use your judgment. If you have any doubts about the ID or the customer, or encounter a situation in which it does not seem reasonable to deliver a tobacco product (e.g., a location where minors are present and appear to be the intended recipients), do not complete delivery and contact support.
III. DECLINE CUSTOMER-INITIATED REQUESTS FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS
If a customer reaches out to you directly (e.g., via the in-app chat feature or by phone) to request that you add a tobacco product to their order, it is important to decline the request.  Third party delivery of tobacco products is illegal in many states.  Even in states where tobacco delivery is legal, initiating the delivery outside of normal processes violates DoorDash’s Consumer Terms and Dasher Policies, and could also unintentionally result in a noncompliant delivery - e.g., a delivery without an ID check and/or without collection of a signature upon delivery.  Declining the request will protect you, the merchant, the customer, and DoorDash.  If the customer is insistent with their request, you can always contact support for assistance.

Delivering Alcohol Guidelines,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Delivering-Alcohol-Guidelines,"Delivering Alcohol Guidelines
Alcohol Orders:
Alcohol delivery for DoorDash has expanded to reach the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. 

Alcohol delivery is optional, and opting out of this type of delivery will not impact your ability to receive other orders from restaurants, grocery stores, retail partners, and more. If you wish to opt-out of this type of delivery, please submit your request to support@doordash.com. In addition, if you ever receive an alcohol order you do not wish to perform, you have the option to decline the order before accepting it or cancel the order before picking it up from the merchant.
Alcohol Delivery:
While on a dash, you may see orders containing alcoholic beverages, and the following information is intended to help you lawfully deliver alcohol with DoorDash. You could be held liable if you deliver alcohol to a minor or someone who is visibly intoxicated or if you leave the alcohol unattended, so it’s important that you know what to do to protect yourself and the consumer.

Important reminders:
You must check the recipient’s identity by following instructions in the Dasher app before you hand them an order containing alcohol. You will be prompted to scan ID and also visually compare the recipient’s appearance to the ID they provide. You cannot leave an alcohol order unattended or hand it to someone else who cannot produce a valid ID.
Dashers cannot consume alcohol prior to or while dashing—or be under the influence of anything.
Dashers must be of legal drinking age (21+) and have a valid government-issued ID to deliver orders containing alcohol. Have your ID ready when you pick up the order—merchants will ask for it. 
This is serious business. You may be held criminally liable if you provide alcohol to a person who is underage or intoxicated or leave alcohol unattended.

Liability for an unlawful alcohol delivery may include:
Fines or jail time.
Civil lawsuits that individuals may bring against delivery persons to recover damages for personal injury or property resulting from an unlawful alcohol delivery, which typically results in a monetary fine (but a criminal action can result in jail time).
DoorDash may also take such other remedial action up to and including deactivation from the DoorDash platform. Remember, we’re here to support you! If you have any questions before, during, or after a dash, get in touch with us through the Dasher app.
The following is the Dasher’s guide in Delivering Alcohol.

Dasher requirements
Dashers must be of legal drinking age and have a valid government-issued ID to deliver orders containing alcohol. Have your ID ready when you pick up the order—merchants will ask for it.

Dashers must complete required education modules in specific states. Without completing such a module, it is illegal to complete deliveries. You can access the required module through your Dasher app under your ‘Profile’.
  How do I know if the order contains alcohol?
You'll see a notice on the screen indicating the order contains restricted items, including alcohol.
Once you click “Accept'', the Dasher app will include the steps required to deliver alcohol safely and compliantly in accordance with applicable state law.

  Key delivery rules to remember
Don't accept additional orders or special requests for alcohol directly from the consumers (for example, if they reach out via text or message you in the app)
Don't leave an order unattended for a consumer to collect. You must deliver the order in person, scan a valid form of ID, and then do a physical examination of the ID, all before handing over the order to the recipient.
Use your best judgment. Remember, you can always refuse to deliver if a person appears below the legal drinking age but presents an ID saying they are older or, if they are of legal drinking age, but are at a location with several other persons who appear under the age. Circumstances matter, so be vigilant, especially when near locations with persons typically under the legal drinking age, such as college campuses.

Restricted locations
Public or private school (K-12) (such as an elementary school);
College campus (including a fraternity or sorority house);
Prison, reformatory, veterans’ home, or state capitol grounds;
Locker or similar package storage service (such as a storage facility); or
Business that sells alcohol (like a grocery or liquor store).
If you arrive at a consumer’s address with an alcohol order, and you see that the address is, or you reasonably suspect that it is, one of the above locations, you are empowered to refuse delivery. Follow the “Can’t complete delivery” instructions in your Dasher app which will guide you on what to do with the alcohol.
  How to verify the consumer’s identity
(Remember: you must verify the consumer’s identity and that they are over the legal drinking age before handing them the order)

Follow the steps in the Dasher app. Upon delivery, you’ll be prompted to scan the recipient’s physical ID, which looks like this:
    
To the extent the scan is successful and the app indicates that the ID is valid, then do a physical examination of the ID to ensure that it is valid and that it matches the recipient. Take a close and long look — make sure the person on the ID is the same person you’re handing the order to, that the ID is not expired, does not display any evidence of fraud (more details on that below), and is for an individual over the legal drinking age. Only hand over the alcohol after having successfully completed these two ID checks.

Note: In states that require a signature, you’ll also be prompted to collect the consumer’s signature.

There are 4 valid, acceptable forms of ID:
State ID Card or Driver’s License
U.S. Military ID
U.S. Passport
Foreign Country Passport
These are INVALID, non-acceptable forms of ID:
Non-government ID (ex. college ID or work ID)
Credit Card
Printed copy or photo of an ID
Expired IDs
What to check a physical ID for:
Check the photo and physical description to make sure they match the consumer.
Confirm both the expiration date and the consumer’s date of birth.
For physical IDs, hold it to see if it’s been tampered with or if it looks like a fake.
Some things to consider for confirming a valid physical ID:
Some states use raised text or embossed elements that you can feel on valid IDs.
A valid ID will NOT include images of a lock or key. 
In some states, a valid ID can also include holographic images. These 3D images change when the ID is viewed at different angles.
How to spot a fake:
The edges of a valid ID should be smooth and uniform, whereas the edges of a fake ID may be rougher or coming apart.
Valid identification should NOT include words like 'genuine', 'souvenir', 'official', 'novelty' or 'authentic'.
If the lamination is split, thin, or has bubbles, it may have been tampered with.
Severely damaged IDs should not be accepted.
Remember, you can always refuse to deliver if a person appears below the legal drinking age but presents an ID saying they are older.
  Preventing Delivery to Underage Customers
Rules in the United States

By law, you must be 21 years or older to purchase, possess, or consume alcohol.
People under the legal drinking age may not purchase or receive alcohol.
People of the legal drinking age or older may not purchase alcohol on behalf of someone under the legal drinking age.
Why staying compliant matters
Be sure to follow the law. If a delivery person makes an illegal alcohol delivery, they may be personally liable. Fines or jail time can be issued to you by government authorities, and individuals may bring lawsuits against a delivery person to recover damages for personal injury or property.

Remember, we’re here to support you! If you have any questions before, during, or after a dash, get in touch with us through the Dasher app.
Preventing Delivery to Intoxicated Customers
It's illegal to serve someone alcohol who is already intoxicated. The law requires that alcohol SHOULD NOT be delivered to a consumer who appears to be intoxicated with any substance (such as alcohol or cannabis, for example).
Here are some common signs that someone’s had too much to drink:
Look for glassy or bloodshot eyes or if someone clearly has difficulty keeping their eyes open.
If you notice that the person’s breath or clothes smell of alcohol, this may be an effective tell-tale sign of intoxication.
If someone is having trouble walking in a straight line or is fumbling with objects, this may be a sign that they are intoxicated.
Use your best judgment.
How to refuse delivery
Your right to refuse delivery
If you suspect someone is underage or intoxicated, you ALWAYS have the right to refuse delivery of alcohol. 
If no one is home to accept an order, you must not complete the delivery.
If you are suspicious that the recipient is using a fake ID, do not deliver alcohol products to them. 
If you suspect that the consumer is accepting the delivery on behalf of someone else who is underage, you must refuse delivery. 
How to refuse delivery
Politely tell the consumer that you cannot deliver the alcohol.
Follow the instructions in your Dasher app which will guide you on what to do with the alcohol.
Should a potentially tricky situation arise, get to a safe location and call the police 
What to do with undeliverable orders

What if no one is home?
Alcohol cannot, under ANY circumstances, be left unattended at a consumer’s door.
Follow the ""consumer unavailable” instructions and the Dasher app will prompt you to return the alcohol to the store.
New Jersey Dasher Requirements
Delivery Worker (i.e., each Dasher) acknowledges that, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 33:1-35 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act (""ABC Act""), as an independent contractor providing contracted services through the DoorDash Platform, governed by the DoorDash Independent Contractor Agreement and the Delivering Alcohol Guidelines included therein, he or she is required to cooperate with inspections and investigations conducted by any authorized representative of the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (""NJABC""), upon presentation of credentials, and to provide documentation or other items and information upon demand in accordance with the requirements of this permit, the ABC Act and regulations. Delivery Worker agrees to fully cooperate with any inspection or investigation by NJABC. Failure to cooperate with an inspection or investigation may result in administrative charges being issued against the Permittee (i.e., DoorDash).   
Delivery Worker acknowledges that DoorDash is required to terminate its agreement for alcohol delivery with any Delivery Worker who violates this permit (i.e., DoorDash's third party alcohol delivery permit), the ABC Act or regulations.
Appendix: step-by-step guide
Check out this step-by-step guide below to navigating orders in-app—you’ll see exactly what the deliveries look like as well as the steps to complete a compliant, successful delivery.

How to tell if the order contains alcohol?

You'll see a notice on the screen indicating the order contains restricted items, including alcohol. When you accept, be sure to have your ID ready to present to the Merchant when picking up the order. Note that Dashers must be at the legal drinking age and have a valid government-issued ID to deliver orders containing alcohol.
    Drop-off instructions
When delivering alcohol, you must follow each step in the Dasher app. You’ll be prompted to scan the customer’s ID and verify their identity BEFORE you hand over the alcohol. In states that require a signature, the Dasher app will prompt you to collect the customer’s signature before you hand over the alcohol.
    
  Scan the customer’s ID and verify the customer’s identity.

Follow the instructions in the Dasher app to scan the customer’s ID and verify that the ID matches the person you’re delivering the alcohol to. Confirm by tapping ‘Verify’. If you cannot confirm, tap ‘Can’t verify’ and follow the instructions in the Dasher app. 
       If you’re prompted in the Dasher app, collect the customer’s signature.
 
  Complete the delivery.
    NOTE: For orders that cannot be delivered (for example, if the Customer is unavailable, underage, or intoxicated), you will be prompted to return the order to the store for additional return pay.

Once signed into your Dash, our system will automatically look into offers for you. When you get an offer, you will receive a notification, and the delivery or task details will appear in your app. You have 45 seconds to choose to accept the offer. When the offer is accepted, the route to the store will appear, and from there you can choose to open the route in your default mapping service.

Note that during peak times, you may receive multiple offers at once. If you're already on an order and you are offered a new one, you'll have 45 seconds to decline or accept it. In some test markets, Dashers will have 90 seconds to decline or accept a batched offer.

If you are on a NO-CONTACT delivery or task, please go to this page instead. For “HAND IT TO ME” deliveries or tasks, continue reading. 

In order to complete a delivery or task, you must hand the food directly to each customer. In cases where the customer is unavailable to accept the delivery, your delivery or task can also be completed by following the steps below. Failing to either hand the delivery to the customer or follow the below steps can put your account at risk of deactivation.
Once you arrive at or near the customer’s location, swipe arrived to let the customer know.
If you are having trouble finding the customer, try calling and texting the customer to let them know you’ve arrived. It helps to try both, because some customers don’t receive texts from DoorDash, while others can’t answer their phones or won’t answer an unknown number.
If the customer does not respond, click the “Customer unavailable” button in the Dasher app. This will also notify the customer that you are having difficulty reaching them. (See pictures below)
Your app will show a timer, which gives the customer a few minutes to come and retrieve the food.  If you find the customer, great! You can give them the food.
If the customer has not arrived when the timer runs out, you will be prompted to a screen that will allow you to “Leave the Order” and show where you left it. The app will guide you to:
5.1. Leave the food somewhere safe as long as a return is not required. If a return is required, you will see that in the app and will have been notified before you accepted the offer. We recommend you select a safe and protected location to leave food (examples: in front of the unit or front door, with a receptionist/doorman, in a mailroom)
5.2. Document where you left the food in the app with a picture and description.
For orders containing alcohol, the Dasher app will instruct you to return the alcohol to the store or dispose of it. Alcohol cannot, under ANY circumstances, be left unattended at a customer’s door. For more details on alcohol orders, see Delivering Alcohol Guidelines.

If you are having trouble finding this feature in the app, please reach out to our support team.

As is stated in the Service Provider Platform Access Policy, failure to complete these steps OR taking the food with you will be considered a failure to complete the delivery or task, and can serve as the basis for deactivation from the DoorDash platform.

What does it look like in the app?



  What happens if a customer reports they didn't receive the order?

When a customer reports that you have not delivered an order, we will review the delivery or task details to ensure that the above actions were taken. In cases where you have not completed these steps, your account will be eligible for deactivation.

We will communicate with you in cases of a customer report. You can expect to receive:

Arrive on-time. Arrive to the store at or slightly before the quoted pickup time. Contact the customer upon arrival, but no more than ten minutes early. If it seems like you are going to be arriving late to the store, contact the store or DoorDash support.
Verify you are picking up the correct order. Share the order ID and confirm the customer’s name with the store to confirm you are picking up the right items. Also, review the receipt to ensure you are picking up the correct order
Confirm you have each item in the order. After swiping to indicate your arrival at the restaurant, your Dasher app will display all the items in the order. Double-check the order contents to ensure items are not missing and all special instructions have been followed. Feel free to ask the merchant to help you do a final item check.
If you are missing an item or have a different item than the order states, ask the merchant if the item is unavailable or substituted. If the merchant confirms unavailable or substituted, report this using the three dots next to the item in the Dasher app pickup screen. This will inform the customer and provide a refund to the customer if the item is unavailable.

  Alcohol Orders
While on a dash, Dashers in the US who are over 21 years old and have a valid driver’s license may see orders containing alcohol beverages. When handling alcohol, it’s important to keep the law in mind and deliver alcohol compliantly.
Please review DoorDash’s Delivering Alcohol Guidelines to ensure you know how to deliver orders containing alcohol. Remember, you could be held liable if you deliver alcohol to a minor or someone who is visibly intoxicated, so it’s important that you know what to do to protect yourself and the customer.
Important reminders:
You must verify the customer’s identity before you hand them an order containing alcohol. You cannot leave an alcohol order unattended or hand it to someone else.
Dashers cannot consume alcohol prior to or while dashing—or be under the influence of anything.
This is serious business. You may be held liable if you provide alcohol to an underage person or a person who is intoxicated.
Remember, we’re here to support you! If you have any questions before, during, or after a dash, get in touch with us through the Dasher app.

DoorDash Drive
DoorDash Drive orders are large deliveries that require special handling and are reserved for qualifying Dashers. For detailed instructions, please review the Drive Dasher Help Page.

Can I dash in different cities if I travel or move?,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Can-I-dash-in-a-different-city-than-I-signed-up-in,"Can I dash in different cities if I travel or move?

Yes! As long as DoorDash is available in a city, you can dash there.
Since DoorDash serves thousands of cities, your ability to earn money is not restricted to a small geographic area. Many Dashers enjoy dashing and making money as they travel all over their country!
The only limitation is that you cannot dash outside of the country where you reside (e.g. if you’re a US-based dasher you cannot dash in Canada).

How do I dash in a new location?
If you are in a new area that is near your most recent dashing location, you can immediately DASH NOW or SCHEDULE A DASH without making any changes on your Dasher app.

If, on the other hand, you want to dash in a completely new area that’s not near your most recent dashing location, you can automatically update your dashing location right in the Dasher app.

To update your dashing location:
Open the Dasher app and tap on ""Dash Now"".
You'll see a pop-up confirming you would like to dash in your new location. Clicking ""Okay"" will change your dashing location and allow you to start a dash.
  If Dash Now is not available (area is gray), you have 2 options:
Wait until Dash Now is available in the area. When it becomes available, tap Dash Now to start your dash and click okay on the pop up that asks if you want to switch your dashing location.
Navigate to a different starting point where Dash Now is available (light pink and red zones), then Click Dash Now. Click okay in the pop up that asks if you want to switch your dashing location"

If our system detects you are outside the customer’s drop-off location, you might have issues marking the customer’s order as delivered.

FAQs. 
Q: When would I encounter this error?
A: You could encounter this error when you try to “Complete delivery steps” or “Complete delivery” on the drop-off flow and DoorDash detects that you are not at the customer’s desired drop-off location. This means that you are either at the wrong location or that you need to get closer to the customer's location before proceeding to drop off the order. 
 

Q: What does the error look like? A: You will see a notice that looks like a warning that you may be at the wrong location and you will see options for what you can do next. Read the warning message carefully, double-check that you are at the correct customer address and pin location, and select the appropriate option for your situation to proceed.
    Q: What if I am at the correct location and still get the error?
A: You can follow the prompts to explain their situation and in most cases will be able to proceed with the drop-off without having to contact support. 

Q:  Why am I getting this error? 
A: This error is shown because DoorDash detects that you may not be at the right location and is intended to encourage you to double-check the details before proceeding. This is to help prevent accidental drop-off mistakes on your part and to help you avoid any delivery errors that could lead to ""Order Never Arrived"" contract violations.

If the issue persists, then contact Support."

Help, my Red Card is not working!

What is a Dasher Red Card?
The Red Card is a prepaid card that Dashers use to pay for items on Dasher Shop & Deliver offers. The card will automatically be funded when you go to check out for a shopping offer. Red Cards are not linked to Dasher bank accounts or related to earnings.
Red Cards can be:
Digital - stored in the digital wallet in your phone (recommended)
Physical - physical card ordered from the DoorDash store

Why do I need a Red Card?
DoorDash Shop & Deliver offers can only be completed with a Red Card. We suggest to make sure to bring a Red Card with you so that you can accept these offers and take advantage of every earning opportunity. Most merchants accept contactless payments so you will likely be able to check out with a digital card. If you are checking out at a merchant that does not accept contactless payments, you can use your physical Red Card if you have one. If you do not have a physical Red Card, you have the option to use your personal card, keep the receipt, and reach out to support for reimbursement.

Schedule a Dash
In the Dasher app, go to the Schedule tab.

Note: If your Dash Now button says Schedule a Dash, you can do the scheduling from there too.
In the Available tab, you’ll see the upcoming days of the week at the top. Select a day.
You can choose a starting point and available times for your Dash.

  Note: If your preferred time is not shown, we’ve reached scheduled Dasher capacity for that time slot. Our schedule is constantly updating and we suggest checking back later, or choosing another starting point.
Once you see a Dash you like, tap on it to select your preferred Start and End Times within the given timeframe. 
Tap Save Dash.
That’s it! You’re now scheduled to Dash for that area, day and time.
  Delete or Edit a Scheduled Dash
We understand that things may come up and you may need to delete or edit the start and/or end times for your scheduled Dash. You can do this within the app!
Go to the Schedule page.
Tap on the day you’ve scheduled a Dash.
Tap on the Scheduled tab.
Scroll through the times and tap on the Dash you’d like to delete or edit.
To delete, tap on Delete in the top right corner.
To edit the start or end time, tap on the time, select your new time, click Done and then Save Dash.
  Scheduling Tips
If you don’t see a city and time that works for you (i.e. can’t schedule a dash), this means that we have enough Dashers on the road for your preferred area and time. Check back later as additional time slots may open up.
Remember that you can always sign in to the app at any time and Dash Now if available. If Dash Now isn't available, it means that we have reached the number of Dashers needed in that area. Please try again later. 
If you have a previous Dash scheduled, you will not be able to schedule a new Dash or extend a current Dash within 30 minutes of the scheduled Dash start. This is to give you enough time to head to that scheduled area."

Head inside to collect the the order. Once you enter the restaurant, you will be able to swipe right at the bottom of your app to confirm arrival. For some orders, you’ll need to pay for the food with your Red Card. For many others, you’ll simply grab the food and go. Your Dasher app will advise what to do: pay with Red Card or pick up items without payment. When you have the order, the Dasher app will prompt you to check off the items listed on the app and swipe right once again to confirm.
Head to the customer. You can tap Navigate to get instructions on how to get to the customer. Once you arrive you may be prompted to swipe you arrived. Customers may have a delivery preference and will provide delivery instructions. Take a look before you head towards the customer's address so you know what to do!

Dashers in the US
If you earned $600 or more in 2024 on the DoorDash platform, you’ll receive a 1099-NEC form via our partner Stripe. Click here to visit the Stripe Support article.

Important to keep in mind: 
Eligible Dashers who earned $600 or more in 2024, will be receiving an email from Stripe by mid-January 2025. Emails will be sent out in phases to Dashers starting in October 2024. 
The subject line is “Get your DoorDash 2024 tax forms faster by enabling e-delivery”.
Starting in October: Stripe will email you instructions on how to set up a Stripe Express account. You’ll need to create an account to access and download your 1099 tax form. We strongly suggest opting into paperless delivery (i.e., agree to receive your 1099 tax form electronically via Stripe Express) to ensure you receive your 1099 quickly. You will need an account to download your 1099 tax form.
By December 31, 2024: Confirm your tax information (e.g., name, address, and SSN or EIN) is correct via Stripe Express. This information must match the information provided to DoorDash.
By January 31, 2025:
Your 1099 tax form will be available to download via Stripe Express if you agree to paperless delivery. 
Your 1099 tax form will be mailed to you. If you don’t receive an email from Stripe or don’t agree to paperless delivery, please allow up to 10 business days for mail delivery.
DoorDash will file your 1099 tax form with the IRS and relevant state tax authorities.
April 15, 2025: IRS deadline to file individual tax returns. You’ll need your 1099 tax form to file your taxes.
If you received a Stripe email asking you to confirm your TIN (Tax Identification Number) in order to keep your account active, please use the unique link sent to you. This information is not to create a Stripe account, this information is used to ensure we have the correct TIN number for every Dasher on the platform. This email was only sent to certain Dashers so if you did not receive one, that means we have your correct information and no action is needed.

Frequently Asked Questions
Q: What is a 1099-NEC tax form?
A: 1099-NEC forms are federal income tax information forms used to report earnings and proceeds other than wages, salaries and tips (which are reported on the federal W-2 form). The forms are filed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and, if required, state tax departments. A 1099-NEC form summarizes Dashers' earnings as independent contractors in the US. It’s provided to you and the IRS, as well as some US states, if you earn $600 or more in 2024. If you're a Dasher, you’ll need this form to file your taxes.

Q: What tax forms will be sent?  
A: The only tax form that eligible Dashers will receive is the 1099-NEC, and this is ONLY for Dashers who earn $600 or more on the platform in 2024. Dashers who earn less will NOT receive a 1099 form.

Q: How will tax forms be delivered?
A: Eligible Dashers who earned more than $600 in 2024 will be receiving an email invite to create a Stripe Express account by mid-January 2025. The email subject line is “Get your DoorDash 2024 tax forms faster by enabling e-delivery”. If you do not receive the email invitation before mid-January but earned $600 or more in 2024 on DoorDash, contact DoorDash support by clicking here. Please note that you will only receive a 1099-NEC if you earned $600 or more in 2024.

Q: How can I check my mileage for tax deduction purposes?  
A: As an independent contractor, managing your own business and expenses can be tough. Your business-related mileage can be a significant expense, so if you know how many miles you drove, you may be able to reduce the amount you owe for taxes (or increase your refund). See here for an IRS publication on Standard Mileage Rates at a Glance.
DoorDash will send mileage estimate emails in late February 2025 to US & Canada Dashers active during 2024 who dashed by Car and had on-delivery mileage.

Keep in mind that DoorDash does not provide you with tax advice. If you have any questions about your own taxes and what business-related expenses may be deductible, please consult a tax professional.

Q: How do I update my tax information?
A: Dashers who earned more than $600 in 2024 should receive email invitations from Stripe by mid-January 2025. Click the “Get Started” button in the invite email and follow the steps to set up your Stripe Express account. You’ll be able to review and edit your tax information directly in Stripe Express. Please update your information no later than December 31st, 2024.

If you’re looking to update your Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), which would be either your Social Security Number (SSN) or Employer Identification Number (EIN), please note that you will first need to create a Stripe Express account using the invitation sent to you. If you already created your account and have access to your e-copy of your 1099-NEC, please follow these steps: Go to the ‘Platform Settings’ → Select the arrow → Select the pencil icon under ‘Personal Details’ to edit the Social Security Number or Employer Identification Number.

Please note: If you don’t consent to e-delivery by mid-January 2025, we’ll automatically mail your 1099 tax form to the address on file, so it’s critical that your information is current, correct, and complete. You can still update your information via Stripe Express after mid-January 2025 and download your 1099 electronically. However, you will not be mailed a new paper copy of your 1099 tax form.

Q: How can I download my 1099 tax form?
A: If you create a Stripe Express account and agree to paperless delivery, Stripe will email you to let you know when your 1099 tax form is available for download via Stripe Express. If you don’t agree to paperless delivery, Stripe will mail you a paper copy of your 1099 tax form instead.


Q: I did not receive the invitation email from Stripe.
A: Dashers who earned more than $600 in 2024 should receive email invitations from Stripe by mid-January 2025. Emails will be sent out in phases to eligible Dashers starting in October 2024. If you did not receive an invitation from Stripe but believe you should have received one based on your 2024 earnings, please check the following:
Check your spam and deleted folders. The subject of the email is “Get your DoorDash 2024 tax forms faster by enabling e-delivery”.
Confirm that you have the correct email address added to your DoorDash Dasher account.
Confirm whether you earned $600 or more on DoorDash in 2024. If you earned less than $600 in 2024, you will not receive a 1099-NEC form or the Stripe invitation.
Important: If you confirmed all of the above, please contact DoorDash support by clicking here. Please note that if you did not receive the Stripe invitation but did earn $600 or more during the year 2024, please allow up to 10 business days from January 31, 2025 for mail delivery. You can request a new invite email from Stripe by following the steps at the link here.

Q: How do I get in touch with Stripe or DoorDash for more help?
A: If you still need help, please contact Stripe support. To contact DoorDash support, click here. We recommend looking through the 1099 tax forms resource pages.

Q: How do I login to my Stripe Express account?
A: Please note that in order to log into your Stripe Express account, you would have had to accept the Stripe Express invitation that will be sent to you via email. If you are having issues logging in after creating an account, please click here.

Q: I no longer have access to the phone number I signed up with. How do I login to my Stripe Express account?
A: If you’ve lost or updated your phone number, you can select the “I no longer have access to this phone number” option to authenticate via email and change your phone number.

Q: Why is Stripe requesting my Social Security number (SSN), Employer Identification Number (EIN), or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)?
A: Your SSN, EIN, or ITIN is required to file your 1099 tax form with the IRS and relevant state tax authorities.

Q: When answering the account claim security questions, it states that my answers are incorrect, what should I do?
A: Please reach out to DoorDash support to confirm the information that we have on file against the information you are providing.

Q: How can I get my 2024 DoorDash earnings history?
A: Dashers do not need to calculate their 2024 earnings themselves - that will be clearly indicated on your 1099 form. However, if you want to estimate your earnings prior to receiving your 1099 form:
All Dashers can do so by logging in to Stripe Express. 
Dashers who had earnings deposited through DasherDirect should also check their Payfare account (via the app DasherDirect By Payfare) because DasherDirect deposits are not reflected in Stripe Express. 
You can view and download your monthly earnings statements on the Dasher App, please click here for more information.

Note that reimbursements (e.g., if you paid for an offer with cash) are not included in 1099 earnings because reimbursements are not taxable.

Fast Pay allows Dashers to cash out their earnings daily for a small fee of $1.99. This means that Dashers can receive their earnings on demand through DoorDash, rather than waiting for their weekly direct deposit or using a third party service.

Note that you must have a debit card - not a prepaid card - to use the Fast Pay service.

DasherDirect is a prepaid Visa card that allows US Dashers to get their earnings after every dash. The funds will be deposited to their DasherDirect account. They will be available within one to two hours, for no additional fee or charge.

DasherDirect FAQ
 "
Why did I receive multiple offers at once?,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Why-did-I-receive-multiple-orders-at-once,"Why did I receive multiple offers at once?
While dashing, getting more offers means more opportunities to earn! Sometimes, you may even get multiple offers at the same time or sequentially. These are called “batched offers”.

What are the advantages of batched offers?
Batched offers allow Dashers to quickly complete two or more orders in less time than usual. Often, batched offers will be picked up at the same restaurant, which increases a Dasher's earnings and efficiency. These batches may happen from time to time, especially during peak hours.
How can I accept and complete batched offers?
You can accept a batched offers one of two ways:
Accepting an offer that shows 2 or more orders on the offer screen
Accepting an additional offer while on your way to pick up the first order, by clicking the ""Add to Route"" button
To simplify completing batched offers, the Dasher app will suggest an order of operations for the batch, but as always, you are free to use your best judgment when choosing how to deliver each order. To see all of the orders during a batched offer (and switch between them if you wish), tap the menu at the top of the Dasher app.

Note that when Peak Pay is in effect, it may be paid per single or batched delivery."
How do I get more offers and make more money?,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/How-do-I-get-more-orders,"How do I get more offers and make more money?

High-earning Dashers know that making more money while dashing often comes down to accepting and completing more offers! The Dashers with the highest earnings are typically those who actively accept and complete a high number of delivery requests.

Getting more offers

Timing is Everything
The most active times for orders tend to be around lunch and dinner. Log on and be ready to accept offers during these peak hours when demand from customers is at its highest.
Take Advantage of Peak Pay
Keep an eye on Peak Pay campaigns within the Dasher app, where you can earn extra money on top of the standard pay for each delivery. These campaigns are usually available during the busiest times and in busy areas.
Red Card (U.S only) and Proximity
Having your Red Card on hand allows you to receive a wider range of orders. Additionally, staying as close to the merchants as possible not only can get you orders faster but also maximize your efficiency.
Equipment and Dash Preferences
Make sure that your account preferences are set to maximize your delivery opportunities. Certain orders may also require you to have a specific type of vehicle. It’s a good idea to periodically review your settings to ensure they align with your current availability and capabilities.
Hotspots Are Your Friend
Watch for areas marked with a red flame icon, known as hotspots. These are prime locations for accepting offers due to their proximity to restaurants with frequent orders. Positioning yourself near these hotspots can increase the likelihood of receiving more delivery requests.
Seek Out High-Demand Areas
Your Dasher app is designed to help you identify the busiest areas with a color-coded map – red zones often represent areas with a higher number of available orders.

How do I refer other Dashers?,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/How-do-I-refer-other-Dashers,"How do I refer other Dashers?
This page will cover frequently asked questions surrounding the Referrals program, such as how to access the page, how to send referral links, and tracking delivery progress and bonus payout.

How do I access the Referrals page?

Referral bonuses are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. To see if a referral bonus is currently available in your area, click on the “Promos” button on the Dash tab or navigate to the Account tab. If there is a live referral bonus, a ""Refer a friend to dash!"" banner will appear at the top of the screen. Clicking into it will show the bonus amount you'd each receive if the person you refer completes the required number of deliveries in the given timeframe. To send a referral link, click the icon on the banner at the bottom, or simply tap on the link to copy the url to your clipboard. 
   How do I know if my friend has successfully been referred?

To successfully accept your referral, your friend must be a new Dasher (has never created a Dasher account), and must start signing up to be a Dasher using your unique link.
If eligible to be referred, your friend will see a blue banner at the top of their signup page and throughout their application process. To start dashing toward the referral bonus, your friend must successfully complete onboarding to become a Dasher. Referral offers are refreshed weekly and are subject to change, so timeliness is encouraged to make sure your offer is locked in.

Once activated, you and your friend will earn bonuses once they’ve completed the required number of deliveries in their area, within the timeframe specified in their offer. 
  I am unable to refer others currently. When will I be able to refer friends?

Dashers in good standing who have completed 30 deliveries and have been dashing for at least 30 days, who have also passed our quality checks will be eligible to refer friends and family to dash. Quality checks are done to ensure a Dasher is in good standing (ie Dasher is not sharing accounts, not engaging in fraud, and has not been flagged for suspicious behavior or incomplete deliveries while Dashing). Referral eligibility is reviewed periodically by our team. Referral bonuses are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. Sometimes, there may not be an active referral offer in your area, but rest assured we will let you know when there’s a new referral opportunity available to you! 

   


  
How can I track the progress of my referrals?

From the referrals page, click on the “Check status” button to view your active referrals. You will be able to see how many deliveries your friends have done toward their referrals and also be able to check in on them to encourage their progress.
  . 
My friend sees a different offer than the one I initially referred them under. Why might these be different? 

Referral offers are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. The in-progress referrals on the Referrals page reflect offers that are locked in when your friend completes their signup to be a Dasher.  

In some cases, offers might get refreshed between the time you send a link and when your friend successfully becomes a Dasher.

Your friend may also see a different offer if they are located in a different city and have opted to dash there. You will both receive the bonus tied to the offer they’ve selected.

All Dasher referrals are governed by terms and conditions that can be found below.
REFERRAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

"Can I be reimbursed for toll, parking fees, parking tickets or traffic tickets?",https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Can-I-be-reimbursed-for-toll-parking-fees-parking-tickets-or-traffic-tickets,"Can I be reimbursed for toll, parking fees, parking tickets or traffic tickets?

DoorDash will not reimburse for toll, parking fees (including tickets) or traffic tickets. Per the Independent Contractor Agreement, you, as the Contractor, will determine how to deliver using the DoorDash platform which includes where to park to pick up or deliver and the route you will take. Any tolls or parking fees paid or parking tickets or traffic tickets received are at your expense and DoorDash will not reimburse for these items.

Top Dashers suggest to select the route option to avoid tolls in your mapping app and abide by your local parking and traffic laws.

You can review the Independent Contractor Agreement HERE."
Stay busy and earn more with Hotspots,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/How-can-I-find-hotspots-in-my-area,"Stay busy and earn more with Hotspots

We built Hotspots to help Dashers find deliveries quickly while on the road. A Hotspot is an area within your Dashing starting point that indicates the busiest areas for orders. You will generally see Hotspots near areas with many restaurants. To increase your chances to receive more orders, simply position yourself closer to a Hotspot. Hotspots are meant to guide you to busy areas and they are consistently refreshed throughout the day, but they do not guarantee orders. 
You can only see hotspots on your Dasher map while dashing and they will be displayed as a circle with a flame icon. Please see below for the two different types of Hotspots you may encounter.

Dynamic hotspots
Dynamic hotspots are created when a certain restaurant or area currently has a lot of orders. Dynamic hotspots will have a red area around it highlighting the full area of busy restaurants and will say “Busy hotspot zone” at the bottom of the screen. You do not have to be within the red area to receive an order, but the closer you get the more likely you are to get an order. 

  Historical Hotspots
Historical hotspots are shown as the flame icon without the red area around them and say “Previously busy Hotspot zone” at the bottom of the screen. You will see historical Hotspots when it isn’t busy enough to create a dynamic Hotspot. These Hotspots are based on recent data and guide you to restaurants that are usually busy at that time. 
Frequently Asked Questions 
Q: What should I do if I am being told there are no Hotspots available?
A: If the Dasher app is telling you there are no Hotspots available, your app is still working and you can still receive orders. This just means there isn’t any location that is busy enough to create a Hotspot.
During these times, it is best to head to your favorite area to wait for orders.
Q: How often do Hotspots update?
A: Hotspots will update as different restaurants become busy and will refresh every 10 minutes. You can follow them, but areas that have recently been Hotspots often remain good areas to receive orders.
The Dasher app will show you the Hotspot closest to you by default, but you can scroll through other nearby Hotspots at the bottom of the screen."
Where should I pickup food at a restaurant?,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Where-should-I-pickup-food-at-a-restaurant,"Where should I pickup food at a restaurant?

The best Dashers tell us there are two different scenarios you may encounter when you arrive at a restaurant. This is what they suggest.

If you have to place the order yourself:
Go to the counter and place the order.
Use your Red Card to pay for the order.
Wait in the designated restaurant waiting area for the food to be prepared.

If you do not have to place the order yourself:
Go to the takeout counter.
Say you are there to pick-up an order for your DoorDash customer.
If the food is not yet prepared, wait in the designated restaurant waiting area for the food to be prepared.

Do Dashers receive tips?,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Do-Dashers-receive-tips,"NOTE: This article only applies to Dashers in the United States and Canada.

Do Dashers receive tips?

Yes! Dashers receive 100% of all customer tips that DoorDash receives, including those earned on DoorDash Drive orders.

Many customers tip as they place an order during order checkout, and you will see these tips listed immediately in your earnings.
Please note that customers are also able to tip after the delivery if they chose not to do so at checkout, which may increase your total earnings per delivery. You’ll receive a push notification when a customer adds a post-delivery tip on any previous order, and you will see an updated earnings breakdown for that delivery.
Of course, customers can always provide cash tips as well!

Why is my total earnings balance negative?,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Why-is-my-total-earnings-balance-negative,"Why is my total earnings balance negative?

Item has run out/is unavailable,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Item-has-run-out-is-unavailable,"Item has run out/is unavailable

If an item has run out or is unavailable, you can easily report this within the pickup screen in your Dasher app by following the next steps:
Click on the 3 dots next to the item name on the pickup screen within the Dasher app.
Here you can choose one of two options:
The item is unavailable with no substitution
The item is unavailable and will be substituted with a different item.
A notification will be automatically sent to the customer and if there is no substitution, the customer will receive a refund. Additionally, the merchant’s menu is updated to show that the item is currently unavailable so no other customers will have this experience.

Another course of action you can take is to contact the customer directly. You should ask if there is an item of the same value that they would like to replace the unavailable item with and then communicate that to the merchant to be prepared.

However, if the customer prefers to substitute with an item of a different value or just wants the price of the unavailable item refunded, then let the customer know they can reach out to DoorDash Support to modify the order. The customer can start a chat with an agent by going to the order tracker page in the mobile app or website, selecting Help in the upper right-hand corner of the tracker, and pressing Make adjustments to this order.

If a customer or restaurant asks you to modify the order in any way (add or remove items, deliver later, etc.), please request that they contact DoorDash Support and do not make any changes to the order on their behalf. Otherwise, we will not be able to track the appropriate charges. Once they contact Support to modify, you will see the order update in-app.

If a restaurant says your delivery was picked up by another Dasher, you may choose to double-check before contacting support. If you remind the restaurant that many customers have similar names, show the restaurant the order on your phone, and read some of the items to them, restaurants may realize that they are thinking of a different DoorDash order.

However, if the restaurant still believes the delivery was already picked up--or if you choose not to double-check--you can contact support immediately through the Dasher app. Support will contact the restaurant to remake the order so you can complete the delivery as usual.

Look for Peak Pay to Maximize Earnings
Look for Peak Pay on the Dash Now Tab to maximize earnings. When peak pay is available, you can make more by completing deliveries or tasks. For instance, in the example above, you can Dash in CA: San Mateo /RedwoodCity and earn an extra $2.00 per offer until 11 am.

Navigate to areas where Dash Now is Available
If Dash Now is not available (the area is grey) and you want to get on the road, you can tap on a different area. If the area is close enough, you can tap ""Dash Along the Way"" to get offers on the way to the new area. Once your Dash has started, you can accept offers and start earning."
How to Accept an Offer,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/How-to-Accept-an-Order,"How to Accept an Offer
Once signed into your Dash, our system will automatically look into offers for you. When you get an offer, you will receive a notification, and the delivery or task details will appear in your app. You have 45 seconds to choose to accept the offer. When the offer is accepted, the route to the store will appear, and from there you can choose to open the route in your default mapping service.

Note that during peak times, you may receive multiple offers at once. If you're already on an order and you are offered a new one, you'll have 45 seconds to decline or accept it. In some test markets, Dashers will have 90 seconds to decline or accept a batched offer.

"How do I view, claim and deliver a DoorDash Drive order?",https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/How-do-I-claim-Drive-orders-in-advance,"Drive Large Order Assignments 
Starting June 2, 2022, large orders will no longer be pre-claimed. Instead, they’ll appear in the Dasher app like a regular delivery. You’ll know that it’s a large order when you see ‘Catering Bag Required’ on the acceptance screen. This is part of a broader effort to improve the assignment process for high-value deliveries.
You’ll still have priority access to these high-value orders — just for being a valuable part of our Large Order program.

Frequently Asked Questions: 
  Q: Why can I no longer claim deliveries the prior day?
A: Starting June 2, Drive deliveries will only be offered as you’re out on your regular dash and can no longer be pre-claimed.
Q: I’ve not seen any orders available to claim in the scheduled tab for the past X weeks. Was I removed from the program?
A: Nope, you’ve not been removed from the program. You’re still eligible to receive Drive catering deliveries, they’ll just be offered in real-time. You may have seen an icon that looks like this in the accept modal as you’re dashing:
  Q: Do I still have priority access to catering deliveries?
A: Yes, you’ll still receive priority access to catering delivery opportunities — just for being a valuable part of our Large Order program. Dashers in this program are first in line to receive high-value catering delivery opportunities.
Q: How can I tell which deliveries are catering with the new process?
A: These deliveries will let you know to bring your catering bag with you into the restaurant to complete and will look similar to the below in your Dasher accept modal:
  Q: What advantages do I receive with Large Orders?
A: Large Orders pay on average 2-3X that of a normal marketplace delivery. And you’ve still got preferential access to receive these delivery offers. Be on the lookout for this icon in the accept modal to flag these larger delivery offers. 
 
Q: Why are you making this change?
A: Over the past couple of months, we received numerous reports from Dashers that our pre-claimed system is not functioning as intended. In order to improve your overall dashing experience, we will be moving Drive deliveries to a more effective assignment algorithm.

Q: Why am I not able to view my Drive ratings page? 
A: The separate Drive ratings page has been removed as part of a broader effort to improve the assignment process. Ratings for Large Order deliveries will now be included together with your overall delivery rating. Starting June 2nd, you will start to notice that more of these Drive deliveries are being offered in real-time as you dash. You will continue to get priority access to these Large Order deliveries over regular dashers
Q: Will you still use my ratings to determine which window I can pre-claim Drive deliveries?
A: No, Dashers will no longer be able to pre-claim deliveries as they will all be offered real-time.
Q: I would like to know more about the Large Order Program
A: To learn more about the Drive LOF Program, please visit our Dasher Help Center article by clicking here.

Can't mark as complete
If our system detects you are outside the customer’s drop-off location, you might have issues marking the customer’s order as delivered.

FAQs. 
Q: When would I encounter this error?
A: You could encounter this error when you try to “Complete delivery steps” or “Complete delivery” on the drop-off flow and DoorDash detects that you are not at the customer’s desired drop-off location. This means that you are either at the wrong location or that you need to get closer to the customer's location before proceeding to drop off the order. 
 

Q: What does the error look like? A: You will see a notice that looks like a warning that you may be at the wrong location and you will see options for what you can do next. Read the warning message carefully, double-check that you are at the correct customer address and pin location, and select the appropriate option for your situation to proceed.
    Q: What if I am at the correct location and still get the error?
A: You can follow the prompts to explain their situation and in most cases will be able to proceed with the drop-off without having to contact support. 

Q:  Why am I getting this error? 
A: This error is shown because DoorDash detects that you may not be at the right location and is intended to encourage you to double-check the details before proceeding. This is to help prevent accidental drop-off mistakes on your part and to help you avoid any delivery errors that could lead to ""Order Never Arrived"" contract violations.

If the issue persists, then contact Support."

Below are some steps to avoid incorrectly reporting a store as closed:
Read the pick-up instructions in your app 
Check that you are at the correct address 
See if there is a drive-thru that might be open 
Check for dedicated or alternate entrances 
Check if the store is closed for dine-in but open for takeout

I'm not getting delivery opportunities,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/I-m-not-getting-delivery-opportunities,"I'm not getting delivery opportunities

There are days when you might notice a change in the number of delivery opportunities available. This can be influenced by a variety of factors. Here are a few things to consider that may help improve your experience.

Tips to Help You Get More Deliveries
Stay Mobile: Changing your location can sometimes make a difference. If your current spot is slow, consider moving to different areas where you have previously had success. There is also a higher chance of getting orders if you move closer to restaurants.
Check Your Preferences: Make sure that your account preferences are set to maximize your delivery opportunities. It’s a good idea to periodically review your settings to ensure they align with your current availability and capabilities.
Check Your Equipment: Certain orders may require you to have a Red Card (US only) or the correct type of vehicle. For instance, you might not receive an order if you are on a bicycle and the order requires a car. Double-check that you have all the necessary equipment to meet the delivery needs of stores in your area.
Stay Updated: Keep your app up-to-date to ensure that you're receiving all potential delivery requests. An outdated app can sometimes lead to unexpected issues.
Be Available During Peak Times: Aligning your schedule with known busy periods can increase your chances of receiving more delivery requests.
By staying flexible and keeping an eye on how market conditions affect delivery volumes, you'll be better prepared to make the most of your time dashing.

Delivering Tobacco Guidelines,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Delivering-Tobacco-Guidelines,"Delivering Tobacco Guidelines
DoorDash does not currently allow Merchants to directly sell tobacco products, electronic cigarettes, or other similar products on our consumer-facing Marketplace platform.
However, in some states, provinces, and territories where it is legal, Merchants with a tobacco-specific agreement with DoorDash may request Dasher delivery of tobacco products that customers have purchased directly from the Merchant through the Merchant’s own channels or through other platforms.  
The following information is intended to help you responsibly and lawfully deliver tobacco products in those circumstances.  Please note that you could be held liable if you deliver tobacco products to a minor, so it's important that you follow this process fully to protect yourself, the customer, and the health and safety of minors.  As a reminder, you are free to decline any delivery offer, including tobacco deliveries.
I. TOBACCO PRODUCT PICK-UP
Tobacco orders are age-restricted in accordance with local law.  In order to pick up a tobacco order, you will be required to present your valid driver's license or another valid government-issued ID, so please make sure you have your ID on you before accepting the order.

II. TOBACCO PRODUCT DROP-OFF
A. AGE AND ID VERIFICATION
You can only deliver tobacco products to a customer if the customer meets the minimum age requirement under local law:
21+ in the U.S.
18+ in Australia; or 
18, 19, or 21+ in Canada in accordance with provincial law.
To verify age, ask the customer to see a valid ID.  Check every customer’s ID every time, even if the customer clearly appears to be over the legally-required age.  A valid ID must include a photograph and date of birth.  For example, acceptable forms of ID may include:
A valid driver's license or identification card issued by federal, state, provincial, county, or municipal government.
A valid passport.
An identification card issued by the Armed Forces of the United States that contains the name, date of birth, description, and picture of the person.
Next, make sure the ID is not invalid or fake:
Check the expiration date. Do not accept an ID that is expired.
Ask to remove the ID from the wallet.
Compare the customer at the door to the photo in the ID.  Examine facial features: are the height, eye shape, ear and nose shape or placement similar?  Ignore weight, hair and makeup as these may change.
Feel the edges of the ID - a legitimate ID will have smooth, uniform edges.  A fake ID may have rougher edges and perhaps may be coming apart.
Look for glue lines or bumpy or uneven surfaces. A real ID’s surface should be consistent.
If the customer’s ID check fails your physical examination or an app-prompted ID scan, do not complete the delivery; instead, return the tobacco product(s) to the merchant.

B. RESTRICTED LOCATIONS
Do NOT, under any circumstances, deliver tobacco products to the following locations:
Public or private school (K-12) (e.g. an elementary school);
Hospitals & health care facilities;
Sports venues or any place hosting a sporting event;
College campus (e.g. a fraternity house, residence hall, library);
Prison, reformatory, veterans’ home, or state capitol grounds;
P.O. Boxes;
Locker or similar package storage service (e.g. a storage facility); or
Other business that sells tobacco products (e.g. tobacco retail shop).
C.  JUDGMENT
Lastly, use your judgment. If you have any doubts about the ID or the customer, or encounter a situation in which it does not seem reasonable to deliver a tobacco product (e.g., a location where minors are present and appear to be the intended recipients), do not complete delivery and contact support.
III. DECLINE CUSTOMER-INITIATED REQUESTS FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS
If a customer reaches out to you directly (e.g., via the in-app chat feature or by phone) to request that you add a tobacco product to their order, it is important to decline the request.  Third party delivery of tobacco products is illegal in many states.  Even in states where tobacco delivery is legal, initiating the delivery outside of normal processes violates DoorDash’s Consumer Terms and Dasher Policies, and could also unintentionally result in a noncompliant delivery - e.g., a delivery without an ID check and/or without collection of a signature upon delivery.  Declining the request will protect you, the merchant, the customer, and DoorDash.  If the customer is insistent with their request, you can always contact support for assistance.

Delivering Alcohol Guidelines,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Delivering-Alcohol-Guidelines,"Delivering Alcohol Guidelines
Alcohol Orders:
Alcohol delivery for DoorDash has expanded to reach the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. 

Alcohol delivery is optional, and opting out of this type of delivery will not impact your ability to receive other orders from restaurants, grocery stores, retail partners, and more. If you wish to opt-out of this type of delivery, please submit your request to support@doordash.com. In addition, if you ever receive an alcohol order you do not wish to perform, you have the option to decline the order before accepting it or cancel the order before picking it up from the merchant.
Alcohol Delivery:
While on a dash, you may see orders containing alcoholic beverages, and the following information is intended to help you lawfully deliver alcohol with DoorDash. You could be held liable if you deliver alcohol to a minor or someone who is visibly intoxicated or if you leave the alcohol unattended, so it’s important that you know what to do to protect yourself and the consumer.

Important reminders:
You must check the recipient’s identity by following instructions in the Dasher app before you hand them an order containing alcohol. You will be prompted to scan ID and also visually compare the recipient’s appearance to the ID they provide. You cannot leave an alcohol order unattended or hand it to someone else who cannot produce a valid ID.
Dashers cannot consume alcohol prior to or while dashing—or be under the influence of anything.
Dashers must be of legal drinking age (21+) and have a valid government-issued ID to deliver orders containing alcohol. Have your ID ready when you pick up the order—merchants will ask for it. 
This is serious business. You may be held criminally liable if you provide alcohol to a person who is underage or intoxicated or leave alcohol unattended.

Liability for an unlawful alcohol delivery may include:
Fines or jail time.
Civil lawsuits that individuals may bring against delivery persons to recover damages for personal injury or property resulting from an unlawful alcohol delivery, which typically results in a monetary fine (but a criminal action can result in jail time).
DoorDash may also take such other remedial action up to and including deactivation from the DoorDash platform. Remember, we’re here to support you! If you have any questions before, during, or after a dash, get in touch with us through the Dasher app.
The following is the Dasher’s guide in Delivering Alcohol.

Appendix: step-by-step instructions
Dasher requirements
Dashers must be of legal drinking age and have a valid government-issued ID to deliver orders containing alcohol. Have your ID ready when you pick up the order—merchants will ask for it.

Dashers must complete required education modules in specific states. Without completing such a module, it is illegal to complete deliveries. You can access the required module through your Dasher app under your ‘Profile’.
  How do I know if the order contains alcohol?
You'll see a notice on the screen indicating the order contains restricted items, including alcohol.
Once you click “Accept'', the Dasher app will include the steps required to deliver alcohol safely and compliantly in accordance with applicable state law.

  Key delivery rules to remember
Don't accept additional orders or special requests for alcohol directly from the consumers (for example, if they reach out via text or message you in the app)
Don't leave an order unattended for a consumer to collect. You must deliver the order in person, scan a valid form of ID, and then do a physical examination of the ID, all before handing over the order to the recipient.
Use your best judgment. Remember, you can always refuse to deliver if a person appears below the legal drinking age but presents an ID saying they are older or, if they are of legal drinking age, but are at a location with several other persons who appear under the age. Circumstances matter, so be vigilant, especially when near locations with persons typically under the legal drinking age, such as college campuses.

Restricted locations
Public or private school (K-12) (such as an elementary school);
College campus (including a fraternity or sorority house);
Prison, reformatory, veterans’ home, or state capitol grounds;
Locker or similar package storage service (such as a storage facility); or
Business that sells alcohol (like a grocery or liquor store).
If you arrive at a consumer’s address with an alcohol order, and you see that the address is, or you reasonably suspect that it is, one of the above locations, you are empowered to refuse delivery. Follow the “Can’t complete delivery” instructions in your Dasher app which will guide you on what to do with the alcohol.
  How to verify the consumer’s identity
(Remember: you must verify the consumer’s identity and that they are over the legal drinking age before handing them the order)

Follow the steps in the Dasher app. Upon delivery, you’ll be prompted to scan the recipient’s physical ID, which looks like this:
    
To the extent the scan is successful and the app indicates that the ID is valid, then do a physical examination of the ID to ensure that it is valid and that it matches the recipient. Take a close and long look — make sure the person on the ID is the same person you’re handing the order to, that the ID is not expired, does not display any evidence of fraud (more details on that below), and is for an individual over the legal drinking age. Only hand over the alcohol after having successfully completed these two ID checks.

Note: In states that require a signature, you’ll also be prompted to collect the consumer’s signature.

There are 4 valid, acceptable forms of ID:
State ID Card or Driver’s License
U.S. Military ID
U.S. Passport
Foreign Country Passport
These are INVALID, non-acceptable forms of ID:
Non-government ID (ex. college ID or work ID)
Credit Card
Printed copy or photo of an ID
Expired IDs
What to check a physical ID for:
Check the photo and physical description to make sure they match the consumer.
Confirm both the expiration date and the consumer’s date of birth.
For physical IDs, hold it to see if it’s been tampered with or if it looks like a fake.
Some things to consider for confirming a valid physical ID:
Some states use raised text or embossed elements that you can feel on valid IDs.
A valid ID will NOT include images of a lock or key. 
In some states, a valid ID can also include holographic images. These 3D images change when the ID is viewed at different angles.
How to spot a fake:
The edges of a valid ID should be smooth and uniform, whereas the edges of a fake ID may be rougher or coming apart.
Valid identification should NOT include words like 'genuine', 'souvenir', 'official', 'novelty' or 'authentic'.
If the lamination is split, thin, or has bubbles, it may have been tampered with.
Severely damaged IDs should not be accepted.
Remember, you can always refuse to deliver if a person appears below the legal drinking age but presents an ID saying they are older.
  Preventing Delivery to Underage Customers
Rules in the United States

By law, you must be 21 years or older to purchase, possess, or consume alcohol.
People under the legal drinking age may not purchase or receive alcohol.
People of the legal drinking age or older may not purchase alcohol on behalf of someone under the legal drinking age.
Why staying compliant matters
Be sure to follow the law. If a delivery person makes an illegal alcohol delivery, they may be personally liable. Fines or jail time can be issued to you by government authorities, and individuals may bring lawsuits against a delivery person to recover damages for personal injury or property.

Remember, we’re here to support you! If you have any questions before, during, or after a dash, get in touch with us through the Dasher app.
Preventing Delivery to Intoxicated Customers
It's illegal to serve someone alcohol who is already intoxicated. The law requires that alcohol SHOULD NOT be delivered to a consumer who appears to be intoxicated with any substance (such as alcohol or cannabis, for example).
Here are some common signs that someone’s had too much to drink:
Look for glassy or bloodshot eyes or if someone clearly has difficulty keeping their eyes open.
If you notice that the person’s breath or clothes smell of alcohol, this may be an effective tell-tale sign of intoxication.
If someone is having trouble walking in a straight line or is fumbling with objects, this may be a sign that they are intoxicated.
Use your best judgment.
How to refuse delivery
Your right to refuse delivery
If you suspect someone is underage or intoxicated, you ALWAYS have the right to refuse delivery of alcohol. 
If no one is home to accept an order, you must not complete the delivery.
If you are suspicious that the recipient is using a fake ID, do not deliver alcohol products to them. 
If you suspect that the consumer is accepting the delivery on behalf of someone else who is underage, you must refuse delivery. 
How to refuse delivery
Politely tell the consumer that you cannot deliver the alcohol.
Follow the instructions in your Dasher app which will guide you on what to do with the alcohol.
Should a potentially tricky situation arise, get to a safe location and call the police 
What to do with undeliverable orders

What if no one is home?
Alcohol cannot, under ANY circumstances, be left unattended at a consumer’s door.
Follow the ""consumer unavailable” instructions and the Dasher app will prompt you to return the alcohol to the store.
New Jersey Dasher Requirements
Delivery Worker (i.e., each Dasher) acknowledges that, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 33:1-35 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act (""ABC Act""), as an independent contractor providing contracted services through the DoorDash Platform, governed by the DoorDash Independent Contractor Agreement and the Delivering Alcohol Guidelines included therein, he or she is required to cooperate with inspections and investigations conducted by any authorized representative of the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (""NJABC""), upon presentation of credentials, and to provide documentation or other items and information upon demand in accordance with the requirements of this permit, the ABC Act and regulations. Delivery Worker agrees to fully cooperate with any inspection or investigation by NJABC. Failure to cooperate with an inspection or investigation may result in administrative charges being issued against the Permittee (i.e., DoorDash).   
Delivery Worker acknowledges that DoorDash is required to terminate its agreement for alcohol delivery with any Delivery Worker who violates this permit (i.e., DoorDash's third party alcohol delivery permit), the ABC Act or regulations.
Appendix: step-by-step guide
Check out this step-by-step guide below to navigating orders in-app—you’ll see exactly what the deliveries look like as well as the steps to complete a compliant, successful delivery.

How to tell if the order contains alcohol?

You'll see a notice on the screen indicating the order contains restricted items, including alcohol. When you accept, be sure to have your ID ready to present to the Merchant when picking up the order. Note that Dashers must be at the legal drinking age and have a valid government-issued ID to deliver orders containing alcohol.
    Drop-off instructions
When delivering alcohol, you must follow each step in the Dasher app. You’ll be prompted to scan the customer’s ID and verify their identity BEFORE you hand over the alcohol. In states that require a signature, the Dasher app will prompt you to collect the customer’s signature before you hand over the alcohol.
    
  Scan the customer’s ID and verify the customer’s identity.

Follow the instructions in the Dasher app to scan the customer’s ID and verify that the ID matches the person you’re delivering the alcohol to. Confirm by tapping ‘Verify’. If you cannot confirm, tap ‘Can’t verify’ and follow the instructions in the Dasher app. 
       If you’re prompted in the Dasher app, collect the customer’s signature.
 
  Complete the delivery.
    NOTE: For orders that cannot be delivered (for example, if the Customer is unavailable, underage, or intoxicated), you will be prompted to return the order to the store for additional return pay.

  Earn cash on deliveries
You can now earn cash on DoorDash deliveries. Put money in your pocket instantly and opt in or out anytime.

How it Works
Opt-in to start receiving orders that pay cash.
Go to the Account tab in your Dasher app. Under Delivery Preferences, toggle on Cash on Delivery Orders. You can opt-in or out any time you want, with no impact on your ratings.

Accept and pick up
Look for orders that say Cash on Delivery and accept just like any other order—the only difference is you’ll get paid in cash when you drop them off.

Get paid the minute you deliver the order.
Once you collect the payment, you’re done. Keep 100% of the cash (including any cash tips). The money you collect is yours to keep, and the order amount will be automatically deducted from your next direct deposit. You can check your weekly earnings breakdown to see any cash amounts deducted. Note that any and all tips are yours to keep and won’t be subtracted from your earning balance.


Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do I have to accept cash orders?
A:  Cash on delivery orders are fully optional. You can turn your preference on or off as often as you’d like, whenever you like. When you opt-in, you may still decline these orders at any time with no impact on your ratings. 

Q: How do I get paid?
A: The customer will pay you in cash, plus any cash tips, for delivering the order. After you’ll keep 100% of the cash you receive and the order amount will be automatically deducted from your next direct deposit. You can check your weekly earnings breakdown to see any cash amounts deducted. Note that any and all tips are yours to keep and won’t be subtracted from your earning balance.

Q: Do I need to carry change?
A: Customers are asked to have the exact total plus tip ready to ensure a quick, and easy drop-off experience. In case they don’t have the exact amount, we recommend carrying $10-15 in small bills.

A: If you encounter an issue: 
Tap Issue Collecting Cash Payment in the Dasher app and select one of the options: Customer was short on cash, I do not have any change, Customer unavailable, or Customer refused to pay.
In those scenarios, do not collect cash from the customer. DoorDash will provide a base pay for the order and your completion rating won't be affected. 
Discard the order if the customer was short on cash, unavailable, or refused to pay. You may deliver the order to the customer if the issue is “I do not have any change.” Remember, you’ll still receive your base pay for the order and your completion rating won’t be affected. If the customer has questions, direct them to contact DoorDash Support.
Q: What should I do if I have an issue collecting the cash payment? 
A: If you need help, we’ve got your back! Reach out to Support anytime through the Dasher app. If you feel unsafe at any point during your Dash, SafeDash is available to you 24/7:

Completing Setup

Some deliveries involve completion of a light setup upon arrival to the customer. If this is part of the Merchant’s requirements for a delivery, you will see a $3 Setup Extra Pay displayed on the scheduled delivery before you choose to do that delivery. You may be asked to set up food trays and lay out utensils. However, you do not need to open food or light sternos.
 
Note: All photos are shared with the Merchant for approval. Failure to submit a clear and accurate photo of the completed setup could impact your Large Order Program eligibility.
  Steps to Complete Setup:
After arriving at the customer, take a picture of your completed setup.
Submit the photo
Wait for your photo to upload and be verified.
Click continue after the successful submission.
 
Customer refuses Set-Up:
If you cannot complete set-up, select “I can’t do setup”.
 
Photo cannot be verified

Routed Deliveries,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Routed-Deliveries,"Routed Deliveries

Overview
A routed delivery is a group of three or more orders with a single pickup location and multiple drop off points along a route.

Frequently Asked Questions:
Q: How will I know if I've been offered a Routed Delivery? 
A: The accept screen will clearly display that the delivery opportunity is a route, and will show you all of the drop-off points. You will also see the estimated completion time and guaranteed earnings for the entire route once completed.

Q: Who can accept Routed Deliveries?
A: All Dashers may receive and accept routed deliveries.

Q: How many orders will be in a route? 
A: These deliveries will have a single pickup location, with 3-10 drop off locations along the route. You’ll see the drop off order in your Dasher app.

Q: What do I do if I can’t reach the customer and need to make a return?
A: If you have called and texted and are still unable to reach the customer, mark “Customer Unavailable” in your Dasher app and wait for the timer to expire.  Once the time expires, a return will be automatically created for you, and you'll be directed to return the order after you've delivered the other items in the route. You will still receive earnings for the return trip. If you are ever unable to reach a customer on a routed delivery, stores request that you return the merchandise to the store. Unlike a marketplace order, stores request you to not leave items unattended at your drop off location.

Q: What if I have an emergency and need to cancel a route during the course of delivery? 
A: If you need to cancel a route after you've picked up the orders, please contact Support by using the phone or chat button in your app, and a Support Agent will assist you on the next steps for a return."

What is Pharmacy delivery?,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/What-is-Pharmacy-delivery,"What is a Pharmacy Delivery?

Pharmacy deliveries are for prescription medication. They operate just like a normal delivery, with a few important differences. 

Frequently Asked Questions: 
Q: Am I eligible to deliver prescriptions?
A: Yes! At this time, all Dashers are eligible to deliver prescriptions. Please note the following unique protocols about sealed packaging when completing pharmacy orders:
Sealed Packages 
All prescription deliveries should be in sealed, non-transparent packages (so you won’t be able to see the contents).
Packages should be sealed by the pharmacy and opened only by the customer out of respect for their privacy. You may request tamper-proof packaging if the pharmacy doesn't seal the package.
If the pharmacy hands you a damaged or see-through package, you may remind them that sealed, non-transparent packaging is required. Contact DoorDash Support if you need additional assistance. 
Q: How do I know this is a prescription delivery? 
A: You’ll know if you received a prescription delivery request because the pickup instructions will direct you to go to the pharmacy counter to pick up the prescription.
There are two layers of acceptance on pharmacy orders. After accepting the order, you’ll also receive an informational “pop-up” that provides information and pharmacy expectations around privacy. At this time, you can either acknowledge the information or unassign from the order.
Q: What if I do not want to accept a prescription delivery?
A: You do not have to accept any deliveries that you do not want to deliver.
Q: What do I do when I get to the customer? 
A: Your Dasher App will prompt you to follow one of the following protocols: 
Signature Capture: Your Dasher App might prompt you to capture a signature and details about the person signing. When a signature is required upon delivery and if an adult is not available to sign, marking “Customer Unavailable” in the Dasher app automatically creates a return delivery. The app will provide information about where and how to return the prescription to the pharmacy. You will receive compensation if you have to complete a return.
Unattended Delivery: When a signature is not required, marking “Customer Unavailable” in the Dasher app will begin a 5-minute timer to give you time to find the customer. At the end of the timer, your app will prompt you to leave the order in a safe location and document where you left the order with a photo and description. If there is no safe place to leave the order, you may chat DoorDash Support so an agent can help you.   
Contactless Delivery: Your Dasher App might prompt you to keep the delivery contactless at the request of the customer. Your app will prompt you to leave the order in a safe location and document where you left the order with a photo and description. If there is no safe place to leave the order, you may chat DoorDash Support so an agent can help you.
What happens if there is an issue on the order?
Wrong Customer Address: Return the prescription to the pharmacy (you will be compensated for this return!) Chat DoorDash Support with any issues. 
Package is damaged: Return the prescription to the pharmacy (you will be compensated for this return!). Chat DoorDash Support with any issues. 
Technical/App Issue: If you have any technical issues, please chat DoorDash Support so an agent can help you.  
Store closed upon return: If the pharmacy is closed, see if there is a store manager present. If not, chat DoorDash Support to confirm next steps! "

Alcohol cannot, under ANY circumstances, be left unattended at a customer’s door. And remember, you cannot give the alcohol to any person other than the customer who made the order.

Follow the “The Customer isn’t Available” (Android) or “Can’t reach the customer” (iOS)” instructions in the Dasher app. After the timer is complete, the Dasher app will instruct you to return the alcohol to the store or dispose of it.

For orders that also contain non-alcohol items, you may leave the non-alcohol items, but the alcohol items must be returned or disposed of (per the guidelines in the Dasher app).

Dasher Ratings Explained,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Dasher-Ratings-Explained,"Dasher Ratings Explained
Unless otherwise notified in writing, the minimum rating threshold(s) for Dashers can be found in the chart below:
Rating Minimum Required
Customer Rating 4.2
Completion Rate 90%
Acceptance Rate No Minimum
On-time/Early Rate Repeated lateness may result in deactivation

Overview
As a Dasher, you’ll receive ratings that help you track the quality of the service you provide on the platform. Ratings determine if you’re eligible to dash, and can also help you qualify for certain programs and incentives.

Some ratings are calculated on a “rolling basis.” This means that as you dash, ratings from past offers will be replaced by ratings from more recent offers — while other ratings are calculated across all your offers. The graphic below helps illustrate how these rolling ratings work. This specific example uses Acceptance Rate, but the same calculation is applied for Completion Rate, as well as Customer Rating:
As a Dasher accepts more offers, the oldest offers are removed. More recent declines will take longer than older declines to be pushed out of the last 100 deliveries used for the calculation. This is why, if a Dasher maintains a high Acceptance Rate, with few declines in their last 100, it may take a large number of accepted offers in a row to remove the small number of declines that exist in the total 100 last offers.

Customer Rating
The overall Customer Rating is a score from 1-5, calculated from the 100 most recent ratings submitted by customers on their offer (not food) experience. This is called a “rolling average,” because new scores replace old scores, allowing Dashers to improve their rating by “pushing out” older lower scores with newer higher scores over time. This means that even if you drop below a 5.0, you can get back up to 5.0 if you continue to earn enough 5-star ratings.

Remember that customers rate their food and their Dasher separately, so your ratings should only reflect the customer’s delivery experience. You can see your current ratings and how they are calculated at any time in the Dasher App in the Ratings tab.

To help make ratings more fair, we remove any Customer Ratings you receive that are below 5 stars in the following circumstances:
Long wait times at restaurants (>10 minutes)
When the delivery or task is already expected to be >15 minutes late when you accept it 
When multiple Dashers before you unassign, causing you to be >15 minutes late 
When the delivery or task is late due to multiple batched offers (3 or more)
Extreme weather conditions (e.g., snowstorms)
Uniquely challenging dashing situations related to protests (at this time, including Customer Rating, Acceptance Rate, and Completion Rate)
System-wide outages (including Acceptance and Completion Rate)
For other app issues, please see our troubleshooting guide here
These adjustments happen automatically. Thank you for your continued efforts to provide services to your customers using the DoorDash platform.

FAQs: 
Q: Why doesn’t my overall rating go up even when I complete a great offer?
A: Your Customer Rating does not include offers in which the customer did not leave a rating. Therefore if you've received 100 ratings so far, and your next offer does not receive a rating from the customer, your rating will remain the same.

Q: I didn’t do any offers recently but my rating changed?
A: Customers may not always immediately leave a rating, so there may be times when your Customer Rating changes well after the offer has been completed. This will likely be why you see your Customer Rating change even if you have not made any offers.

Q: What is the minimum Customer Rating required?
A: Dashers may be deactivated from the DoorDash platform if they have a Customer Rating below 4.2.
Q: How do I improve my average Customer Rating?
A: Dashers may be deactivated from the DoorDash platform if they have a customer rating below 4.2.

Q: How do I improve my average Consumer rating?
A: We can share a number of tips that could help you improve your rating, but do what works best for you. We encourage you to test different things to see what fits you. Here are a few tips that experienced Dashers use to maintain a high Customer Rating:
Ask the merchant to confirm all items are included but do not open sealed bags.
Use a hot bag to deliver meals at the expected temperature to customers.
Separate hot and cold items during transport so they don’t impact one another.
Note and follow the merchant’s pickup instructions and the customer’s drop-off instructions.
Keep the customer updated! Customers always appreciate a heads-up when you’re running a few minutes late or if any clarification is needed for the offer.
Completion Rate
Your Completion Rate is the percentage of deliveries or tasks completed out of the 100 most recent offers you accept. You can increase your Completion Rate by making sure every offer you accept is delivered to the customer. If you unassign in the middle of an offer you accepted, that could impact your Completion Rate.

Assuming a Dasher has accepted at least 100 offers, every additional new accepted offer will bump out the oldest accepted offer. If the latest accepted offer is completed but the oldest accepted offer was also completed, then your overall average will not change. However, if the latest accepted offer is completed and the oldest accepted offer is not completed, then you will see your average increase. Conversely, if the latest accepted offer is not completed but the oldest accepted offer is completed, then the average will decrease.

Once you have passed 100 lifetime deliveries, each additional offer will only have a 1% impact on your average.

FAQs: 
Q: What if the customer or merchant cancels the offer?
A: Offers canceled by a Customer or Merchant are counted as completed offers for purposes of your completion rate. Your completion rate decreases only if you unassign yourself from an accepted offer, or if you call in to Support to request unassignment from an accepted offer. 

Q: What if I have an emergency and can’t complete an offer?
A: We understand that things happen -- your car dies or you have a family situation. That’s why you only need to maintain a minimum completion rate of 90% in order to keep your account on the platform. If you have an emergency during an offer and need to report it, contact Support.

Q: I am completing deliveries — why isn't my Completion Rate going up?
A: Completion Rate is calculated from only the last 100 offers that you accepted. This means that it can take a large number of completed offers in a row before you see an improvement. If your Completion Rate is 94%, that means you only have 6 uncompleted offers in your last 100 accepted offers. In order to raise your rating, you will need to complete every accepted offer until you push one of those 6 uncompleted offers out of your most recent 100. As you can imagine, the fewer uncompleted offers you have in your last 100, the longer it can take to raise your Completion Rate. If your score is already high, there are only so many unassigns to “push out” of your calculation in order to raise it. A visual example of how this works can be found here.

Q: What is the minimum completion rate required?
A: You are required to complete 90% of the offers you accept to remain on the platform. If you are approaching the lower completion rate limit, you will receive a text message that says “Your Completion Rate must be above 90% to remain active as a Dasher.” 
Q: Will my ratings be affected if I unassign from an offer?
A: Unassigning from an offer affects a Dasher’s Completion Rate, you will receive a notification on your app when you accept an offer but later unassign from it. It will also notify you that completion rates below 90% could result in account deactivation.
Q: If I am unassigned by support, will it affect my completion rating?
A: Yes, if you unassign yourself from an accepted offer, either via self-help or by contacting support, your Completion Rate will be affected.


Acceptance Rate
Acceptance Rate is the percentage of deliveries you accepted out of the 100 most recent offers you receive. You can raise your acceptance rate by consistently accepting offers that are offered to you. It is also a “rolling average,” which means it may take a few offers before you see an increase in your average.

There is no minimum requirement for an acceptance rate, but consistently declining offers negatively impact the experience for other Dashers (who will have less time to complete the offer), the customer (who is more likely to get a late delivery or task), and even the merchant (whose food will sit for longer). 
FAQs
Q: I am accepting deliveries but why isn't my Acceptance Rate going up?
A: Acceptance Rate is calculated from only the last 100 offers. This means that it can take several accepted offers before you see an improvement because every additional new offer will bump out only the oldest offer. If your Acceptance Rate is 80%, that means you only have 20 declined offers in your last 100 offers. In order to raise your rating, you will need to accept every offer until you push one of those 20 declines out of your most recent 100 offers. As you can imagine, the fewer declines you have in your last 100, the longer it can take to raise your Acceptance Rate. A visual example of how this works can be found here. The best way to push out declined orders from your score is to consistently accept offers. 
Q: If I let the timer run out, does it still count as declining?
A: If the timer runs out it will count as declining an order and will be reflected in your Acceptance Rate. Remember that you can pause your dash if you are unable to accept opportunities.  You can learn more about ratings in our Dasher
Q: Does declining an offer affect my ratings?
A: Dashers can always decline an offer opportunity. You will see a notification appear if you decline an order assignment giving you a heads-up that your acceptance rate may drop. 
  On-time/Early Rate 
Your on-time/early rate is a percentage based on the number of orders you have completed by the estimated delivery time (or 5 minutes past)
While there is currently no minimum requirement for an on-time/early rate, Dashers are responsible for making sure that deliveries they choose to accept are completed on time. In agreeing to the Independent Contractor Agreement Dashers agree to “complete delivery orders to consumers in a safe and timely fashion.“
Therefore, regardless of their overall On-time/Early rate, Dashers who arrive at the merchant or customer significantly after estimated pick-up or drop-off times will be eligible for deactivation of their account for violating the terms of their ICA.

Drive Ratings 
Q: Is there a separate rating for Drive offers?
A: Ratings for Large Order deliveries or Drive will now be included together with your overall offer rating. 
Q: Why am I not able to view my Drive rating page? 
A: The separate Drive ratings page has been removed as part of a broader effort to improve the assignment process. Starting June 2, 2022, you will start to notice that more of these Drive deliveries are being offered in real-time as you dash. You will continue to get priority access to these Large Order deliveries over regular Dashers"

In order to ensure standards of food safety, merchants may require all Dashers to have an insulated hot bag during their deliveries. You may use any hot bag of your choice. To get a DoorDash hot bag, you can purchase one online at www.doordashstore.com.

Merchants or their building may also require that Dashers wear face coverings when entering their locations.
  Pick up
Do not open food containers or tamper with the order in any way.
Keep it fresh. Wrap the food in your foil blanket, then place it in your hot bag and zip your hot bag closed. Keeping the food hot will ensure food stays safe in transport.
Travel
Secure the food. Customers appreciate the food arriving just like it would at the restaurant. Lay the food flat, and secure your hot bag in your vehicle before you drive to the customer.
Cleanliness
Hot bags last longer and can help with customer ratings when they are clean. Here are few tips for hot bag care from top Dashers.
Wipe your hot bag with a recommended household cleaner for kitchens.
Use a clean towel or paper towels with water to wipe off the cleaner residue.
Use a new clean towel or paper towels to dry the hot bag.

If you would like a new DoorDash hot bag, order one online at www.doordashstore.com.

Here is some great advice from a Dasher in Las Vegas named Diego who has done 3000+ deliveries. He discusses how he uses hot bags to deliver orders quicker and safer (which earns him higher ratings and higher tips)!

Top Dashers recommend keeping customers updated throughout the delivery process, particularly when there are unexpected delays, like a traffic jam or a backed-up kitchen at the restaurant.

In the videos below, hear Top Dashers share their strategies for providing customers with updates.


Dasher Advice from Tamara - Communicating with Customers




Dasher Advice from Randy - Communicating with Customers




Even more advice from Top Dashers:
  On a basic level.......just communicate!  While the app is pretty good about tracking where the dasher is, there are times when customers get impatient. On a normal order, I text when I have the order and what my ETA is.  I am sure to communicate with customers anytime the merchant is taking longer than expected, are out of a requested item, when I have multiple orders to drop off, basically anytime something comes up that may affect the customer, let them know. - Randy, Dasher, Castle Rock CO, 4000+ deliveries
  Send a courtesy text when at the restaurant and let the customer know if there is any wait or if any item is unavailable. Communication plays a major factor and can ultimately lead to a larger tip and better ratings. -  Jonathan, Dasher, Fort Drum NY,  2000+ deliveries
  When you arrive at the restaurant, send a courtesy text to let the customer know you have received their order pick up request and advise them of any expected wait times or possible delays... Communication is the major tool. Ratings and tips will be impacted by more communication with the customers such as “ I’m on the way” or “ my GPS says I should be there in 14 minutes.” - Brian, Dasher, Vancouver BC, 2000+ deliveries
  Use a communication method that works for the customer. If you send a text message and get no response, call the customer. Not everyone embraces text messaging as much as we do... I use templates because that way I don’t have to worry about autocorrects before I send it. It’s easier and quicker when I copy and paste. - Kari, Dasher, Killeen TX, 2000+ deliveries
  

For inspiration, below are examples of text templates that actual Top Dashers use during deliveries that you could adapt for your own use.
  During pickup:
There’s a little wait time at the restaurant on orders, as soon as I get your order I will text you with a live ETA.
Hello, this is your Dasher. Your order is taking a bit longer to prepare than expected. I apologize for any inconvenience. 
Hi this is [name] your Dasher. I'm here at the restaurant but the food is taking a little longer than expected. I'll be there as soon as possible. 
  After pickup:
Hey this is, (your name here)! I just picked up your order and I'm (this many minutes) mins away 🤗
  After drop off:
Hi, I left your order at the door. Have a day/great night! Thank you 😁
This is [name], your Dasher. I left your order at the door! Thank you for ordering  and have a great day. Enjoy!
Batched orders:
Hey this is your Dasher, I’m waiting on your order at the moment. I would like to also let you know I do have a drop off before yours. See you soon!

Customers report that they appreciate it when their Dashers keep them informed during the delivery, which can lead to better tips and ratings.
  Thanks for the updates. Can't believe how crazy it is in there… You'll definitely be getting an extra tip for your patience. - Corryn, Customer

Experience was actually awesome. The Dasher was amazing, he was so amazing - he was patient. He updated me at every twist and turn. He communicated with me every step of the way… He was so understanding and patient. - Cherry, Customer"
How we’re collecting data on ratings,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/How-we-re-collecting-data-on-ratings,"How we’re collecting data on Ratings 

In the Ratings tab of your Dasher App, you may now see more detailed Ratings feedback from customers along several dimensions including Communication, Followed Delivery Instructions, Order Handling, and Friendliness.

When customers select 5 stars, they have the option to provide additional details. Positive comments will show up as a green thumbs up by category in the “Customer Feedback” section in your Ratings tab. If a customer selects 4 stars or fewer, they then have the option to select what element of the delivery could be improved. These selections will show up as a red thumbs down. This additional detail is intended to help Dashers understand both positive and constructive customer feedback. Regardless of how many stars a customer gives, this additional feedback is not required, so some rated deliveries may not generate a thumbs up or a thumbs down.

Customers may include comments explaining how their Dasher went “above and beyond,” or provided exceptional service. As customers complete this section, these quotes will appear in the “Customer Compliments” section of the Ratings tab. So, as a Dasher, you’ll now be able to see the direct feedback from customers for providing exceptional service.

  FAQs: Brought to you by Everlance
Only a tax professional can offer you tax advice. Read on for FAQs, answered by the Everlance team.

What is Everlance and why should I use it?
Everlance is an app that automatically tracks your mileage, expenses, and income and is designed to help independent contractors maximize their tax deductions (which means you get to keep more of your hard-earned money).

Why should I track my expenses as a Dasher?
Simple answer - to save money! As an independent worker, you can “deduct” business expenses from your taxes. Deducting those expenses reduces how much you pay in taxes and increases how much money you get to keep.

What business expenses can I deduct as a Dasher?
If you use a car to dash, that’s probably your biggest business expense: every 100 miles is worth over $54 on your taxes! Even if you don’t use a car for deliveries on the DoorDash platform, there are many other business expenses you can deduct: your phone, your data plan, your ride, your health insurance, your hot bags, and many more. The more you deduct, the more money you keep.

What else can Everlance help with?
As an app that specializes in helping people track mileage and expenses for taxes, Everlance has lots of easy-to-understand, educational resources on taxes, from understanding taxes for independent contractors, to discovering business deductions, to deciphering your 1099 tax form.

Merchant Protocol FAQs,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Merchant-Protocol-FAQs,"Merchant Protocol FAQs

Q: With restaurants closing their lobbies, where should I go to pick up orders?

A: Merchants have begun updating pickup protocols to help keep pickups as low-contact as possible. In order to help ensure smooth and safe pickups, merchants will provide any new pick-up instructions in the Dasher app. Please pay special attention to these notes, as they may change frequently. If a restaurant appears closed, be sure to check for a pickup window or the drive-through (if applicable). 

Q: If a merchant doesn’t have pick-up instructions, what should I do? 

A: If there is a wait for the order to be ready, consider coordinating with the restaurant to wait near your vehicle, instead of in the store, until it is ready to be taken to the customer.

Q: Should I check the contents of a sealed bag?

A: No. Do not open sealed bags. If you receive a sealed bag, both customers and restaurants require that you do not open the package - even to check the contents. If you want to verify the order, confirm the name and its contents with the restaurant staff.

Q: How can I report a merchant as closed?
A: If a restaurant appears closed, please check for a pick-up window or the drive-through (when applicable). If the store has neither, and it’s clear that they are closed:
Once you have arrived at the store, swipe the ""Slide after arrival"" banner.
On the next screen, select ""?"" in the upper right-hand corner of the app.
Choose the option ""Store is closed"".
Take a photo of the closed store.
Press ""Mark store closed"" once you have uploaded a store photo.
A summary will appear on the screen about their payment for this order once the store is successfully reported as ""Store closed"".
If you select the “Unable to take a photo” option, you can either call the store for directions or self-unassign from the order.
NOTE: By self-unassigning, the Completion Rate will be impacted."

What is a Dasher Red Card?
The Red Card is a prepaid card that Dashers use to pay for items on Dasher Shop & Deliver offers. The card will automatically be funded when you go to check out for a shopping offer. Red Cards are not linked to Dasher bank accounts or related to earnings.
Red Cards can be:
Digital - stored in the digital wallet in your phone (recommended)
Physical - physical card ordered from the DoorDash store

Why do I need a Red Card?
DoorDash Shop & Deliver offers can only be completed with a Red Card. We suggest to make sure to bring a Red Card with you so that you can accept these offers and take advantage of every earning opportunity. Most merchants accept contactless payments so you will likely be able to check out with a digital card. If you are checking out at a merchant that does not accept contactless payments, you can use your physical Red Card if you have one. If you do not have a physical Red Card, you have the option to use your personal card, keep the receipt, and reach out to support for reimbursement.

Dash types are different types of transportation methods a Dasher can select to dash. DoorDash tries to find the most suitable order types depending on your dash type. In most markets, you’ll get the most orders if you dash with a car. In other markets that are more difficult to get around in a car, you might find certain areas are more favorable to dash with a bike instead.

Overview

As part of our commitment to help protect the DoorDash community, we are constantly evaluating new ways to help promote safety on the platform. Anyone signing up to dash must pass a secure background check before gaining access to the DoorDash platform.

Most Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What is the process?
A: DoorDash uses accredited third-party background check providers, including Checkr to run secure background checks on all prospective and existing Dashers. Background checks are initiated as part of the signup process, before allowing individuals to access the platform to accept offers as new Dashers. For the continued safety and security of all members of our community, background check reruns are performed under certain circumstances. This allows us to receive and evaluate potential new or updated criminal history records through real-time data sources.

Additionally, Checkr provides a continuous check feature that can report new offenses occurring after your initial complete background check.

Q: What information is contained in a background check?
A: Background checks consist of the following:
Motor Vehicle Report (if using a motor vehicle to dash)
Criminal History Report

Q: What happens if I have a new record since my most recent background check report?
A: If your report reflects an incident or information that results in you no longer meeting the background check criteria, your Dasher account will be deactivated from the platform. You will receive an email if this happens.

Q: How does that process work and how long does it take?
A: If such a record is flagged in your report, you will be notified with a Pre-Adverse Action notice attached to an email sent from no-reply@checkr.com before any deactivation action is taken. That notice will include a copy of your report and additional information, including how you can dispute the accuracy of any information in the background check or provide additional information to be considered. 

If you do not provide any additional information, or dispute the accuracy of your background check with Checkr, within the number of days provided in your Pre-Adverse Action Notice, you will receive a Post-Adverse action notice that provides an explanation of the final decision, and your Dasher account will be deactivated.

Q: How do I dispute the accuracy of my background check or provide more information for DoorDash to consider in its decision?
A: All of the information needed to dispute the accuracy of background check with Checkr, or to provide additional information to Doordash for consideration, is contained in the Pre-Adverse Action notice attached to the email from no-reply@checkr.com. If you believe the findings of the Checkr report are inaccurate (e.g., the charge(s) listed are not your own, details of the charge are incorrect, out of date, etc.), please contact Checkr via their Checkr Candidate Portal. Through the candidate portal, please follow the dispute process which involves specifying what you believe to be inaccurate on your report and following the appropriate steps. For questions or assistance, please contact Checkr Support.

Q: My background check is 'suspended'. What does that mean?
A: This usually indicates that you need to provide Checkr with additional information or documentation in order for your background check to continue processing. You should have received an email from no-reply@checkr.com with instructions, or you can log into the Checkr Candidate Portal to view the status of your background check.

Q: Why is my report taking such a long time?
A: While most background checks are completed within a day, it is not uncommon to encounter longer wait times of one to two weeks due to factors such as DMV and local county office delays. Recall that process includes both a criminal background check and, for those who indicate they will deliver by motorized vehicle, a motor vehicle report check. Individuals who plan to deliver by bicycle do not need to undergo a motor vehicle report check. Please visit the Checkr Candidate Portal for the most up-to-date estimates.

Because the checks are performed by Checkr, not DoorDash, DoorDash is unable to expedite or provide estimated completion times. Contact Checkr Support if you have any further questions about processing times.

Q: Checkr says my report is complete. Why can't I continue to sign up?
A: Complete is a term that Checkr uses to indicate it has finished compiling the information on a report. A report being “Complete” is not an indication that the results of the search have been reviewed or of an individual’s eligibility to access the DoorDash platform. In other words, not all “Complete” reports have been reviewed and received a “Clear” status that would allow you to move on to the next step in the sign-up process. To check whether your completed report is “Clear” or requires any additional action, please log in to the Checkr Candidate Portal.

If you opted to receive a copy of your background check or live in a state that requires a copy to be sent, you should have received an email from Checkr with the subject line “Your DoorDash background check is complete!”.

Q: What does my background check status mean?
A: The answer depends on which message you see when you sign in to your Dasher signup account. The following messages are what you should be looking for:
Clear
Clear: Your background check is clear and you are ready to move on to the next step in the sign-up process. You should have received an email from no-reply@checkr.com with the following message: 

""Congratulations! This message means you have completed and cleared the background check step. Finish the next steps in the app to start dashing.""

Please note: In certain locations, there may be a waitlist to start dashing right away, and you will need to wait for a welcome email from DoorDash

In Progress
Consider: Your background check has been processed by Checkr and has been shared with us for internal review. Click here to view your current status. 

The Consider status means that Checkr has processed your background check, but the results require additional review. 

Reviews are typically completed within 5 business days. To see the results of your review and if you are eligible to Dash, please search your email inbox (the address associated with your Dasher signup) for an email with the subject ‘Pre-Adverse Action Notice’ or ‘Post-Adverse Action Notice’. 

Pending: Your background check is still being processed by Checkr. Click here to view your current status with Checkr and whether they need additional information from you in order to complete your background check.

Sometimes Checkr may require additional information in order to complete the process. Please provide any additional information requested by Checkr by logging in to the Checkr Candidate Portal.

If Checkr has not requested any additional information  or if you have already submitted the requested information, this means your background check is still being processed by Checkr. DoorDash is unable to expedite or provide estimates on wait times, because the reports are compiled and completed by Checkr, not DoorDash. Please visit the Checkr Candidate Portal for the most up-to-date estimated completion time. For additional information regarding estimated completion times, please contact Checkr Support.

Disputed: Your background check dispute is being reviewed by Checkr. Disputed background checks can take up to 30 days.

If you have disputed the results of a report with Checkr, then you may see this status. It means that Checkr has received your dispute and is reviewing it. Checkr requires up to 30 days to process disputes.

Q: How can I check the status of my background check?
A: The background check process varies, but it can take 5-7 business days and, in some instances, a bit longer. If you have questions about the status of your background check, you can reach out to Checkr for more information by:
Clicking on the link below and providing the phone number, email, social security number, and date of birth you used for your background check. Once you have provided the information, click the Get Status button.

Q: I received the 'Pre-Adverse Action Notice' email, what can I do?
A: If you are:

If you received an email with the subject 'Pre-Adverse Action Notice', this means that based on the information in your background check report, you may be precluded from proceeding with the sign up process.

How do I refer other Dashers?,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/How-do-I-refer-other-Dashers,"How do I refer other Dashers?
This page will cover frequently asked questions surrounding the Referrals program, such as how to access the page, how to send referral links, and tracking delivery progress and bonus payout.

How do I access the Referrals page?

Referral bonuses are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. To see if a referral bonus is currently available in your area, click on the “Promos” button on the Dash tab or navigate to the Account tab. If there is a live referral bonus, a ""Refer a friend to dash!"" banner will appear at the top of the screen. Clicking into it will show the bonus amount you'd each receive if the person you refer completes the required number of deliveries in the given timeframe. To send a referral link, click the icon on the banner at the bottom, or simply tap on the link to copy the url to your clipboard. 
   How do I know if my friend has successfully been referred?

To successfully accept your referral, your friend must be a new Dasher (has never created a Dasher account), and must start signing up to be a Dasher using your unique link.
If eligible to be referred, your friend will see a blue banner at the top of their signup page and throughout their application process. To start dashing toward the referral bonus, your friend must successfully complete onboarding to become a Dasher. Referral offers are refreshed weekly and are subject to change, so timeliness is encouraged to make sure your offer is locked in.

Once activated, you and your friend will earn bonuses once they’ve completed the required number of deliveries in their area, within the timeframe specified in their offer. 
  I am unable to refer others currently. When will I be able to refer friends?

Dashers in good standing who have completed 30 deliveries and have been dashing for at least 30 days, who have also passed our quality checks will be eligible to refer friends and family to dash. Quality checks are done to ensure a Dasher is in good standing (ie Dasher is not sharing accounts, not engaging in fraud, and has not been flagged for suspicious behavior or incomplete deliveries while Dashing). Referral eligibility is reviewed periodically by our team. Referral bonuses are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. Sometimes, there may not be an active referral offer in your area, but rest assured we will let you know when there’s a new referral opportunity available to you! 

   


  
How can I track the progress of my referrals?

From the referrals page, click on the “Check status” button to view your active referrals. You will be able to see how many deliveries your friends have done toward their referrals and also be able to check in on them to encourage their progress.
  . 
My friend sees a different offer than the one I initially referred them under. Why might these be different? 

Referral offers are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. The in-progress referrals on the Referrals page reflect offers that are locked in when your friend completes their signup to be a Dasher.  

In some cases, offers might get refreshed between the time you send a link and when your friend successfully becomes a Dasher.

Your friend may also see a different offer if they are located in a different city and have opted to dash there. You will both receive the bonus tied to the offer they’ve selected.

All Dasher referrals are governed by terms and conditions that can be found below.

Note: DoorDash Support cannot schedule (add), edit or extend your Dash. Our app updates in real time and you are able to do this in the app.
Schedule a Dash
In the Dasher app, go to the Schedule tab.

Note: If your Dash Now button says Schedule a Dash, you can do the scheduling from there too.
In the Available tab, you’ll see the upcoming days of the week at the top. Select a day.
You can choose a starting point and available times for your Dash.

  Note: If your preferred time is not shown, we’ve reached scheduled Dasher capacity for that time slot. Our schedule is constantly updating and we suggest checking back later, or choosing another starting point.
Once you see a Dash you like, tap on it to select your preferred Start and End Times within the given timeframe. 
Tap Save Dash.
That’s it! You’re now scheduled to Dash for that area, day and time.
  Delete or Edit a Scheduled Dash
We understand that things may come up and you may need to delete or edit the start and/or end times for your scheduled Dash. You can do this within the app!
Go to the Schedule page.
Tap on the day you’ve scheduled a Dash.
Tap on the Scheduled tab.
Scroll through the times and tap on the Dash you’d like to delete or edit.
To delete, tap on Delete in the top right corner.
To edit the start or end time, tap on the time, select your new time, click Done and then Save Dash.
  Scheduling Tips
If you don’t see a city and time that works for you (i.e. can’t schedule a dash), this means that we have enough Dashers on the road for your preferred area and time. Check back later as additional time slots may open up.
Remember that you can always sign in to the app at any time and Dash Now if available. If Dash Now isn't available, it means that we have reached the number of Dashers needed in that area. Please try again later. 
If you have a previous Dash scheduled, you will not be able to schedule a new Dash or extend a current Dash within 30 minutes of the scheduled Dash start. This is to give you enough time to head to that scheduled area."

How can I protect my DoorDash account information?,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/How-can-I-protect-my-DoorDash-account-information,"How can I protect my DoorDash account information?
Do not share your password or security code under any circumstances.
No one from DoorDash will ever request your password or security code, nor will anyone from DoorDash ever give you a specific password you should use. If you receive a request for your password, security code, or other account details do not share this information -- even if the request appears to come from Support, or the person knows specific details about your order. To maintain the security of your account, it is critical that you keep your password confidential at all times.
Giving out your password lets scammers change your bank account information and steal your earnings by sending them to another bank account - one that they control, not you. You can prevent these scams and keep your earnings secure by keeping your password confidential at all times.
Again, do not share your DoorDash account password or security code under any circumstance.
Nuevamente, no comparta la contraseña o el código de seguridad de su cuenta de DoorDash bajo ninguna circunstancia.
  What are signs the request for information is a scam?
Be alert for these warning signs - and keep your password secure!
While on a small order, the customer calls you to cancel. Then, you receive a call from someone claiming to be “Support” requesting your password in order to remove the order. Hang up - and chat into Support from your app instead! This is a scam!
You’re offered a bonus or financial assistance through a text or call, but need to share your password to receive the funds. DoorDash will never need your password to pay you! Do not give it out. This is a scam!
Someone claiming to be “Support” - but who called or texted you - needs your password urgently to allow you to continue dashing. Stop. Hang up. This is a scam!
Someone calls you and says they are “DoorDash Support,” but then gives you a password you need to update yours to, so that they may access your account and help you. DoorDash Support will never need your password to help you. This is a scam!
An app or website - other than the Dasher app or DoorDash.com - asks for your Dasher account email address and password. This information can be used to access your account. Do not put in your information. This is a scam!
If you encounter one of these scenarios - or another like it - hang up or stop texting immediately. If you need to be in touch with DoorDash Support during one of these cases, contact them directly. If you’re on a dash, use the ""?"" or ""HELP"" button, otherwise contact the Support team by filing a case through the link below.
  If you have shared your password:
Change your password immediately.
Go to your EARNINGS tab. Verify that the bank account is your own. If it is not, update it immediately.
If you have Fast Pay, confirm the details of the Fast Pay debit card are your own. If they are not, change them immediately.
For all other concerns, please file a support case below.

Remember: Do not share your DoorDash account password under any circumstances.
Recuerde: No comparta la contraseña de su cuenta de DoorDash bajo ninguna circunstancia.
  Password Best Practices
A unique password should contain a combination of words, numbers, symbols, upper and lower case letters.
Do not use your login name as your password. Do not use generic words such as ""password"" ""doordash"" or ""user”.
Do not choose your birthdate or social security number.
Do not use adjacent keyboard combinations, such as “asdfg”
Do not use the same password you use to access your email. If you use the same password, and you share your DoorDash password, you are giving scammers access to your email as well. Do not share your passwords!

Overview

As part of our commitment to help protect the DoorDash community, we are constantly evaluating new ways to help promote safety on the platform. Anyone signing up to dash must pass a secure background check before gaining access to the DoorDash platform.

Most Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What is the process?
A: DoorDash uses accredited third-party background check providers, including Checkr to run secure background checks on all prospective and existing Dashers. Background checks are initiated as part of the signup process, before allowing individuals to access the platform to accept offers as new Dashers. For the continued safety and security of all members of our community, background check reruns are performed under certain circumstances. This allows us to receive and evaluate potential new or updated criminal history records through real-time data sources.

Additionally, Checkr provides a continuous check feature that can report new offenses occurring after your initial complete background check.

Q: What information is contained in a background check?
A: Background checks consist of the following:
Motor Vehicle Report (if using a motor vehicle to dash)
Criminal History Report

Q: What happens if I have a new record since my most recent background check report?
A: If your report reflects an incident or information that results in you no longer meeting the background check criteria, your Dasher account will be deactivated from the platform. You will receive an email if this happens.

Q: How does that process work and how long does it take?
A: If such a record is flagged in your report, you will be notified with a Pre-Adverse Action notice attached to an email sent from no-reply@checkr.com before any deactivation action is taken. That notice will include a copy of your report and additional information, including how you can dispute the accuracy of any information in the background check or provide additional information to be considered. 

If you do not provide any additional information, or dispute the accuracy of your background check with Checkr, within the number of days provided in your Pre-Adverse Action Notice, you will receive a Post-Adverse action notice that provides an explanation of the final decision, and your Dasher account will be deactivated.

Q: How do I dispute the accuracy of my background check or provide more information for DoorDash to consider in its decision?
A: All of the information needed to dispute the accuracy of background check with Checkr, or to provide additional information to Doordash for consideration, is contained in the Pre-Adverse Action notice attached to the email from no-reply@checkr.com. If you believe the findings of the Checkr report are inaccurate (e.g., the charge(s) listed are not your own, details of the charge are incorrect, out of date, etc.), please contact Checkr via their Checkr Candidate Portal. Through the candidate portal, please follow the dispute process which involves specifying what you believe to be inaccurate on your report and following the appropriate steps. For questions or assistance, please contact Checkr Support.

Q: My background check is 'suspended'. What does that mean?
A: This usually indicates that you need to provide Checkr with additional information or documentation in order for your background check to continue processing. You should have received an email from no-reply@checkr.com with instructions, or you can log into the Checkr Candidate Portal to view the status of your background check.

Q: Why is my report taking such a long time?
A: While most background checks are completed within a day, it is not uncommon to encounter longer wait times of one to two weeks due to factors such as DMV and local county office delays. Recall that process includes both a criminal background check and, for those who indicate they will deliver by motorized vehicle, a motor vehicle report check. Individuals who plan to deliver by bicycle do not need to undergo a motor vehicle report check. Please visit the Checkr Candidate Portal for the most up-to-date estimates.

Because the checks are performed by Checkr, not DoorDash, DoorDash is unable to expedite or provide estimated completion times. Contact Checkr Support if you have any further questions about processing times.

Q: Checkr says my report is complete. Why can't I continue to sign up?
A: Complete is a term that Checkr uses to indicate it has finished compiling the information on a report. A report being “Complete” is not an indication that the results of the search have been reviewed or of an individual’s eligibility to access the DoorDash platform. In other words, not all “Complete” reports have been reviewed and received a “Clear” status that would allow you to move on to the next step in the sign-up process. To check whether your completed report is “Clear” or requires any additional action, please log in to the Checkr Candidate Portal.

If you opted to receive a copy of your background check or live in a state that requires a copy to be sent, you should have received an email from Checkr with the subject line “Your DoorDash background check is complete!”.

Q: What does my background check status mean?
A: The answer depends on which message you see when you sign in to your Dasher signup account. The following messages are what you should be looking for:
Clear
Clear: Your background check is clear and you are ready to move on to the next step in the sign-up process. You should have received an email from no-reply@checkr.com with the following message: 

""Congratulations! This message means you have completed and cleared the background check step. Finish the next steps in the app to start dashing.""

Please note: In certain locations, there may be a waitlist to start dashing right away, and you will need to wait for a welcome email from DoorDash

In Progress
Consider: Your background check has been processed by Checkr and has been shared with us for internal review. Click here to view your current status. 

The Consider status means that Checkr has processed your background check, but the results require additional review. 

Reviews are typically completed within 5 business days. To see the results of your review and if you are eligible to Dash, please search your email inbox (the address associated with your Dasher signup) for an email with the subject ‘Pre-Adverse Action Notice’ or ‘Post-Adverse Action Notice’. 

Pending: Your background check is still being processed by Checkr. Click here to view your current status with Checkr and whether they need additional information from you in order to complete your background check.

Sometimes Checkr may require additional information in order to complete the process. Please provide any additional information requested by Checkr by logging in to the Checkr Candidate Portal.

If Checkr has not requested any additional information  or if you have already submitted the requested information, this means your background check is still being processed by Checkr. DoorDash is unable to expedite or provide estimates on wait times, because the reports are compiled and completed by Checkr, not DoorDash. Please visit the Checkr Candidate Portal for the most up-to-date estimated completion time. For additional information regarding estimated completion times, please contact Checkr Support.

Disputed: Your background check dispute is being reviewed by Checkr. Disputed background checks can take up to 30 days.

If you have disputed the results of a report with Checkr, then you may see this status. It means that Checkr has received your dispute and is reviewing it. Checkr requires up to 30 days to process disputes.

How do I refer other Dashers?,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/How-do-I-refer-other-Dashers,"How do I refer other Dashers?
This page will cover frequently asked questions surrounding the Referrals program, such as how to access the page, how to send referral links, and tracking delivery progress and bonus payout.

How do I access the Referrals page?

Referral bonuses are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. To see if a referral bonus is currently available in your area, click on the “Promos” button on the Dash tab or navigate to the Account tab. If there is a live referral bonus, a ""Refer a friend to dash!"" banner will appear at the top of the screen. Clicking into it will show the bonus amount you'd each receive if the person you refer completes the required number of deliveries in the given timeframe. To send a referral link, click the icon on the banner at the bottom, or simply tap on the link to copy the url to your clipboard. 
   How do I know if my friend has successfully been referred?

To successfully accept your referral, your friend must be a new Dasher (has never created a Dasher account), and must start signing up to be a Dasher using your unique link.
If eligible to be referred, your friend will see a blue banner at the top of their signup page and throughout their application process. To start dashing toward the referral bonus, your friend must successfully complete onboarding to become a Dasher. Referral offers are refreshed weekly and are subject to change, so timeliness is encouraged to make sure your offer is locked in.

Once activated, you and your friend will earn bonuses once they’ve completed the required number of deliveries in their area, within the timeframe specified in their offer. 
  I am unable to refer others currently. When will I be able to refer friends?

Dashers in good standing who have completed 30 deliveries and have been dashing for at least 30 days, who have also passed our quality checks will be eligible to refer friends and family to dash. Quality checks are done to ensure a Dasher is in good standing (ie Dasher is not sharing accounts, not engaging in fraud, and has not been flagged for suspicious behavior or incomplete deliveries while Dashing). Referral eligibility is reviewed periodically by our team. Referral bonuses are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. Sometimes, there may not be an active referral offer in your area, but rest assured we will let you know when there’s a new referral opportunity available to you! 

   


  
How can I track the progress of my referrals?

From the referrals page, click on the “Check status” button to view your active referrals. You will be able to see how many deliveries your friends have done toward their referrals and also be able to check in on them to encourage their progress.
  . 
My friend sees a different offer than the one I initially referred them under. Why might these be different? 

Referral offers are refreshed weekly and may vary by geographic location. The in-progress referrals on the Referrals page reflect offers that are locked in when your friend completes their signup to be a Dasher.  

In some cases, offers might get refreshed between the time you send a link and when your friend successfully becomes a Dasher.

Your friend may also see a different offer if they are located in a different city and have opted to dash there. You will both receive the bonus tied to the offer they’ve selected.

All Dasher referrals are governed by terms and conditions that can be found below.

Canada Background Check FAQ,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Canada-Background-Check-FAQ,"Canada Background Check 

For Canada Dashers only

How do I get more offers and make more money?,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/How-do-I-get-more-orders,"How do I get more offers and make more money?

High-earning Dashers know that making more money while dashing often comes down to accepting and completing more offers! The Dashers with the highest earnings are typically those who actively accept and complete a high number of delivery requests.

Getting more offers

Timing is Everything
The most active times for orders tend to be around lunch and dinner. Log on and be ready to accept offers during these peak hours when demand from customers is at its highest.
Take Advantage of Peak Pay
Keep an eye on Peak Pay campaigns within the Dasher app, where you can earn extra money on top of the standard pay for each delivery. These campaigns are usually available during the busiest times and in busy areas.
Red Card (U.S only) and Proximity
Having your Red Card on hand allows you to receive a wider range of orders. Additionally, staying as close to the merchants as possible not only can get you orders faster but also maximize your efficiency.
Equipment and Dash Preferences
Make sure that your account preferences are set to maximize your delivery opportunities. Certain orders may also require you to have a specific type of vehicle. It’s a good idea to periodically review your settings to ensure they align with your current availability and capabilities.
Hotspots Are Your Friend
Watch for areas marked with a red flame icon, known as hotspots. These are prime locations for accepting offers due to their proximity to restaurants with frequent orders. Positioning yourself near these hotspots can increase the likelihood of receiving more delivery requests.
Seek Out High-Demand Areas
Your Dasher app is designed to help you identify the busiest areas with a color-coded map – red zones often represent areas with a higher number of available orders.
Expert Advice
Here is advice from a very experienced Dasher in California named Tamara. She has done 1400+ deliveries, and she has some great advice for accepting the most offers and earning the most money while dashing!

From time to time, Dash Now may only be available to select Dashers depending on their equipment type, vehicle type, reward status, or other factors, including but not limited to Top Dasher and Dashers with Priority Access. When the heatmap is grey, Dashers can try navigating to a different area to dash or check back later to see if Dash Now is available.

"How do I view, claim and deliver a DoorDash Drive order?",https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/How-do-I-claim-Drive-orders-in-advance,"Drive Large Order Assignments 
Starting June 2, 2022, large orders will no longer be pre-claimed. Instead, they’ll appear in the Dasher app like a regular delivery. You’ll know that it’s a large order when you see ‘Catering Bag Required’ on the acceptance screen. This is part of a broader effort to improve the assignment process for high-value deliveries.
You’ll still have priority access to these high-value orders — just for being a valuable part of our Large Order program.

Frequently Asked Questions: 
  Q: Why can I no longer claim deliveries the prior day?
A: Starting June 2, Drive deliveries will only be offered as you’re out on your regular dash and can no longer be pre-claimed.
Q: I’ve not seen any orders available to claim in the scheduled tab for the past X weeks. Was I removed from the program?
A: Nope, you’ve not been removed from the program. You’re still eligible to receive Drive catering deliveries, they’ll just be offered in real-time. You may have seen an icon that looks like this in the accept modal as you’re dashing:
  Q: Do I still have priority access to catering deliveries?
A: Yes, you’ll still receive priority access to catering delivery opportunities — just for being a valuable part of our Large Order program. Dashers in this program are first in line to receive high-value catering delivery opportunities.
Q: How can I tell which deliveries are catering with the new process?
A: These deliveries will let you know to bring your catering bag with you into the restaurant to complete and will look similar to the below in your Dasher accept modal:
  Q: What advantages do I receive with Large Orders?
A: Large Orders pay on average 2-3X that of a normal marketplace delivery. And you’ve still got preferential access to receive these delivery offers. Be on the lookout for this icon in the accept modal to flag these larger delivery offers. 
 
Q: Why are you making this change?
A: Over the past couple of months, we received numerous reports from Dashers that our pre-claimed system is not functioning as intended. In order to improve your overall dashing experience, we will be moving Drive deliveries to a more effective assignment algorithm.

Q: Why am I not able to view my Drive ratings page? 
A: The separate Drive ratings page has been removed as part of a broader effort to improve the assignment process. Ratings for Large Order deliveries will now be included together with your overall delivery rating. Starting June 2nd, you will start to notice that more of these Drive deliveries are being offered in real-time as you dash. You will continue to get priority access to these Large Order deliveries over regular dashers
Q: Will you still use my ratings to determine which window I can pre-claim Drive deliveries?
A: No, Dashers will no longer be able to pre-claim deliveries as they will all be offered real-time.

Remember that you can always sign in to the app at any time and Dash Now if available. If Dash Now isn't available, it means that we have reached the number of Dashers needed in that area. Please try again later. 
If you have a previous Dash scheduled, you will not be able to schedule a new Dash or extend a current Dash within 30 minutes of the scheduled Dash start. This is to give you enough time to head to that scheduled area."

Communicating with Customers,https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Communicating-with-Customers,"Communicating with Customers: Advice from Top Dashers on Increasing your Ratings & Tips
Top Dashers recommend keeping customers updated throughout the delivery process, particularly when there are unexpected delays, like a traffic jam or a backed-up kitchen at the restaurant.

In the videos below, hear Top Dashers share their strategies for providing customers with updates.


Dasher Advice from Tamara - Communicating with Customers




Dasher Advice from Randy - Communicating with Customers




Even more advice from Top Dashers:
  On a basic level.......just communicate!  While the app is pretty good about tracking where the dasher is, there are times when customers get impatient. On a normal order, I text when I have the order and what my ETA is.  I am sure to communicate with customers anytime the merchant is taking longer than expected, are out of a requested item, when I have multiple orders to drop off, basically anytime something comes up that may affect the customer, let them know. - Randy, Dasher, Castle Rock CO, 4000+ deliveries
  Send a courtesy text when at the restaurant and let the customer know if there is any wait or if any item is unavailable. Communication plays a major factor and can ultimately lead to a larger tip and better ratings. -  Jonathan, Dasher, Fort Drum NY,  2000+ deliveries
  When you arrive at the restaurant, send a courtesy text to let the customer know you have received their order pick up request and advise them of any expected wait times or possible delays... Communication is the major tool. Ratings and tips will be impacted by more communication with the customers such as “ I’m on the way” or “ my GPS says I should be there in 14 minutes.” - Brian, Dasher, Vancouver BC, 2000+ deliveries
  Use a communication method that works for the customer. If you send a text message and get no response, call the customer. Not everyone embraces text messaging as much as we do... I use templates because that way I don’t have to worry about autocorrects before I send it. It’s easier and quicker when I copy and paste. - Kari, Dasher, Killeen TX, 2000+ deliveries
  

For inspiration, below are examples of text templates that actual Top Dashers use during deliveries that you could adapt for your own use.
  During pickup:
There’s a little wait time at the restaurant on orders, as soon as I get your order I will text you with a live ETA.
Hello, this is your Dasher. Your order is taking a bit longer to prepare than expected. I apologize for any inconvenience. 
Hi this is [name] your Dasher. I'm here at the restaurant but the food is taking a little longer than expected. I'll be there as soon as possible. 
  After pickup:
Hey this is, (your name here)! I just picked up your order and I'm (this many minutes) mins away 🤗
  After drop off:
Hi, I left your order at the door. Have a day/great night! Thank you 😁
This is [name], your Dasher. I left your order at the door! Thank you for ordering  and have a great day. Enjoy!
Batched orders:
Hey this is your Dasher, I’m waiting on your order at the moment. I would like to also let you know I do have a drop off before yours. See you soon!

Customers report that they appreciate it when their Dashers keep them informed during the delivery, which can lead to better tips and ratings.
  Thanks for the updates. Can't believe how crazy it is in there… You'll definitely be getting an extra tip for your patience. - Corryn, Customer

Experience was actually awesome. The Dasher was amazing, he was so amazing - he was patient. He updated me at every twist and turn. He communicated with me every step of the way… He was so understanding and patient. - Cherry, Customer"
